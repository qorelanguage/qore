    @section elasticsearchdataproviderintro Introduction to the ElasticSearchDataProvider Module

    The %ElasticSearchDataProvider module provides a @ref dataproviderintro "data provider" API for ElasticSearch
    instances.

    This data provider provides ElasticSearch API access to:
    - documents: path <tt>document/{create,read,update,delete}</tt>
    - indexes: path <tt>index/{create,read,read-all,delete,search}</tt>
    - pipelines: path <tt>pipeline/{create,read,read-all,update,delete}</tt>

    Furthermore it provides a record interface to ElasticSearch indexes supporting record creating, searching,
    updating, and deleting documents (where an ElasticSearch document is treated as a record) through the following
    path:
    - <tt>indexes/</tt><i>index_name</i>

    These data provides represent a single index with a record-like interface; each document (record) will be returned
    with read-only \c _id and \c _score fields as well.

    In this way ElasticSearch can be used for easy data ingreation and then simple searches as well as manipulation of
    document content and pipelines from the Data Provider API.
