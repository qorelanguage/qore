/** @page variables Variables

    @tableofcontents

    Unless parse option @ref allow-bare-refs "%allow-bare-refs" or @ref new-style "%new-style" are set, variables are %Qore identifiers prefixed by a \c "$" sign, similar to <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>. If a variable is declared without any type restriction, then it is assumed to have type @ref any_type "any". In this case, variables so declared can hold any data type.

    @section special_variables Special Variables

    A few variables are set by the %Qore language during the execution of %Qore programs. These are normal variables that can be reassigned to other values by the user if necessary.

    <b>Special %Qore Variables</b>
    |!Variable|!Scope|!Data Type|!Explanation
    |\c $argv|Local|List|automatically assigned local variable containing the list of function or method arguments that were not assigned to parameter variables (see @ref implicit_arguments for more information)
    |\c Qore::$ARGV|Global|List|script command-line arguments (use the @ref Qore::GetOpt class to parse command-line arguments)
    |\c Qore::$QORE_ARGV|Global|List|complete qore command-line arguments
    |\c Qore::$ENV|Global|Hash|UNIX program environment

    @note
    - As of version 0.5.0, \c $STDERR and \c $STDOUT have been removed from %Qore. Use the I/O constants @ref Qore::stderr, @ref Qore::stdout, and @ref Qore::stdin constants of the @ref Qore::File class instead.
    - As of version 0.8.4, global variables are namespace members; if a namespace path is not declared for the global variable, then the global variable will reside in the root namespace

    @section variable_declarations Variable Declarations and Lexical Scope

    Unless the @ref assume-local "%assume-local" parse directive is used, variables not in a parameter list automatically have global scope unless the first reference is prefixed with @ref my. Variable names in a parameter list are always local to their associated function, method, or catch block. @ref global_variables "Global variables" can be explicitly declared with @ref our. The @ref our keyword is required if the parse option @ref require-our "%require-our" (\c -O or \c --require-our command-line option) is set for the parent program. See @ref parse_options for more information.

    When the @ref assume-local "%assume-local" parse directive is used, variables without an explicit scope declaration (i.e. @ref my or @ref our) are assumed to be @ref local_variables "local variables".

    Variables may be assigned any value unless restricted with a type declaration. If no type declaration is given, then the variable is assumed to be type @ref any_type "any". Note that type declarations are required for all variables (and for function and method parameters and class members) when the @ref require-types "%require-types" parse option is set.

    @ref local_variables "Local variables" are not shared between threads (local variables have a distinct value in each thread, with some very particular exceptions), however global variables are. See @ref threading (and in particular @ref threading_and_variables) for more information.

    Global variables are members of @ref qore_namespaces "namespaces"; if a global variable is declared anywhere outside a namespace declaration, and a namespace path is not given, then the global variable will be assumed to be in the root namespace.

    For example (in the following script, the @ref our keyword is optional unless @ref require-our "%require-our" is set):

    @code{.py}
#!/usr/bin/qore
#
# variable scoping example

our int $a = 1;                    # this is a global variable
our (string $b, any $c, hash $d);  # list of global variables

if ($a == 1) {
    my int $a = 2; 
    my (string $b, any $c);
    # $a, $b, and $c are local variables, 
    # the use of which will not affect the 
    # global variables of the same name
    print("local a = %d\n", $a); 
}

print("global a = %d\n", $a); 
    @endcode

    The first print() statement will output:
    @verbatim
local a = 2@endverbatim

    The second print() statement will output:
    @verbatim
global a = 1@endverbatim

    @note If parse option @ref allow-bare-refs "%allow-bare-refs" is set, then variable references <b>must</b> be made without the "$" character.

    @section local_variables Local Variables
    Local variables are local to the block in which they are declared; they are also thread-local, meaning that each thread will have its own value of a local variable.

    Local variables are generally accessed without any mutual-exclusion locking (with the exception of local variables bound in @ref closure "closures" and local variables that have a @ref lvalue_references "reference" taken of them).
    
    @note Declaring a variable with \b my at the top-level of a program creates a local variable with global scope; in effect this is a global thread-local variable; see @ref threading_and_variables for more information.

    @subsection my The "my" Keyword
    Variables declared with \b my are always local variables.

    <b>my Example</b>\n
    @code{.py} my int $i = 1;@endcode

    The \b my keyword is not required if the @ref assume-local "%assume-local" parse directive is set (note that this parse directive is also set by @ref new-style "%new-style").  In this case, all variables are assumed to be local unless explicitly declared with @ref our "our".

    @section global_variables Global Variables

    @subsection our The "our" Keyword
    Variables declared with \b our have global scope and are subject to mutual exclusion locks with each access.  Therefore even in single-threaded programs, it's more efficient to use local variables (even local variables with global scope - where a local variable is declared in the top-level block) if the value of the variable does not need to be shared among other threads.

    <b>our Example</b>\n
    @code{.py} our int $i = 1;@endcode

    Note that the \b our keyword is required when declaring a global variable if the parse option @ref require-our "%require-our" (\c -O or \c --require-our command-line option) is set for the parent program. See @ref parse_options for more information.  

    Unlike local variables, global variables are members of @ref qore_namespaces "namespaces"; if a namespace path is not given, then the global variable will be assumed to be in the root namespace.  Global variables declared in @ref qore_namespaces "namespaces" cannot be initialized at the same time as the declaration, but instead have to be initialized elsewhere.

    When defining a @ref user_modules "user module", the \b our keyword can be preceded by @ref mod_public "public", which means that the global variable will be available (imported) in the @ref Qore::Program "Program" object importing the module.  See @ref mod_public "public" for more information.
