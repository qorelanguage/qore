    @subsection qore_0812_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module fixes:
      - fixed a bug setting the response encoding in HttpServer::setReplyHeaders() where the Socket encoding was not set properly and therefore the encoding in the Content-Type in the response header did not necessarily match the encoding of the response
    - <a href="../../modules/CsvUtil/html/index.html">CsvUtil</a> module fixes:
      - fixed a bug where the \c "format" field option was not usable with fields assigned type \c "*date"
      - fixed the default field type as "*string" (from "string") to avoid parsing and outputting empty strings for missing input data

      - moved field length checks after all transformations have been applied
      - fixed bugs in the \c "timezone" and \c "input_timezone" options, documented those options
    - fixed a memory error in error-handling with type errors when parsing user module headers that could cause a crash

    - fixed a crashing bug initializing some lvalues with type restrictions; affected static class variables at least
    - fixed a bug where a class calling an overridden method in a base class constructor that referred to a member that should have been initialized in the subclass would be executed before the subclass's members were initialized causing the method call to fail
    - fixed a memory leak in classes with multiple inheritance and base classes that are inherited multiple times with member initialization
    - fixed a bug in the @ref include "%include" and @ref append-module-path "%append-module-path" parse directives where relative paths were not calculated from the script's directory but instead were calculated from the current working directory, causing such paths to fail
    - fixed a bug in <a href="../../modules/SqlUtil/html/index.html">SqlUtil</a> with queries using a \a desc argument with the \a orderby query option with multiple sort columns; the \c "desc" string was added only to the last column but should have been added to all columns
    - fixed a bug in @ref Qore::get_qore_library_info() that could cause a crash due to treating the \a Build attribute as a string when it was an integer

    - fixed a crash when parsing when parsing function, method, or closure arguments when either of the @ref duplicate-local-vars or @ref duplicate-block-vars warnings are set due to an error handling thread-local variable info in parse initialization
    - fixed a bug where code with mixed coding styles (old and new) could result in invalid parse errors when parsing base class constructor calls to a base class defined in another coding style
    - fixed a bug where an HTTP response with an unknown Content-Encoding header would cause a crash

    @section qore_0811 Qore 0.8.11

    @par Release Summary
    Minor bugfix release for UNIX, major bugfixes for Windows

    @subsection qore_0811_new_features New Features in Qore
    - added the @ref Qore::AFMap and @ref Qore::AFStrMap constants
    - <a href="../../modules/WebUtil/html/index.html">WebUtil</a> updates:
      - added logic to the default file serving code to determine if the file is a binary or text file from the MIME type
    - @ref Qore::HTTPClient::sendWithSendCallback() "HTTPClient::sendWithSendCallback()" and @ref Qore::HTTPClient::sendWithSendCallback() "HTTPClient::sendWithSendCallback()" updated such that if a response is received while the chunked send operation is still in progress, an error is assumed, the send operation is aborted, and the response header is read immediately

    @subsection qore_0811_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - Windows fixes:
      - fixed TimeZone copying to use the standard name instead of the display name so that the info can be found in the registry
      - <a href="../../modules/Util/html/index.html">Util</a> module fixes:
        - fixed get_random_string() on Windows
	- fixed absolute_path_windows()
      - <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module fixes:
        - when binding a wildcard address with @ref Qore::AF_UNSPEC "AF_UNSPEC" on Windows with HttpServer::addListeners()
          and both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are returned, bind both addresses since Windows doesn't direct the IPv4 requests to the wildcard-bound IPv6 listener
      - fixed file reading by always opening in binary mode
      - added support for the WSAECONNABORTED socket error
      - replaced Mime::MultiPartMessage::getRandomString() with Util::get_random_string() to make it work on Windows
    - fixed a bug in the DBI layer where calling @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement::describe() "SQLStatement::describe()" would crash when called with an older module that did not implement this method
    - other fixes in the <a href="../../modules/Util/html/index.html">Util</a> module (in addition to the Windows-specific fixes above):
      - fixed parse_to_qore_value() with hashes with a comma in the first key name
      - read from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random since reads from the latter can block for long periods to fill the entropy pool
    - do not start signal thread after a fork() if signal handling is enabled, pthread_create() is not async-signal safe (on FreeBSD at least this reliably causes segfaults)

    - fixed an error in the rounding heuristic for arbitrary-precision numeric values that could produce invalid results (ex: 34.9n * 100 = 34902n)
    - enforce @ref Qore::PO_NO_FILESYSTEM "PO_NO_FILESYSTEM" with the @ref include "%include" directive
    - fixed a bug managing object private data in complex inheritance cases where the same class may be inherited with virtual private data and also real private data
    - fixed a bug in socket timeout handling with select() errors
    - fixed a memory leak in handling abstract methods when multiple abstract methods with the same name but different signatures were declared in a class

    @section qore_088 Qore 0.8.8

    @par Release Summary
    Major new features and bug fixes with a particular focus on enhanced HTTP capabilities and enhanced database processing

    @subsection qore_088_compatibility Changes That Can Affect Backwards-Compatibility
    - Fixed method resolution order; it's now possible to call pseudo-methods directly on classes that implement @ref methodGate_methods "methodGate() methods"
    - Added the following abstract methods to @ref Qore::SQL::AbstractDatasource "AbstractDatasource":
      - @ref Qore::SQL::AbstractDatasource::getConfigHash() "AbstractDatasource::getConfigHash()"
      - @ref Qore::SQL::AbstractDatasource::getConfigString() "AbstractDatasource::getConfigString()"
    - "hard" string comparisons now perform encoding conversions if necessary (however as usual different data types cause the comparison to fail)

      - Qore::HTTPClient::getDefaultPath(): added
      - Qore::HTTPClient::setDefaultPath(): added

      - Qore::Socket::readHTTPHeaderString(): new method
      - Qore::Dir: all list*() methods now take an optional parameter to return a list of @ref stat_hash "file status value hashes" plus \c "name" and optionally \c "link" keys for symbolic links; additionally symbolic links are now followed and files and directories are differentiated based on their targets when processing symbolic links
    - function changes
      - added optional \a start and \a end parameters to the @ref Qore::replace "replace()" function
    - all @ref data_type_declarations "data type declarations" that optionally accept @ref nothing also now accept @ref null and map @ref null to @ref nothing; this makes direct assignments from values derived from SQL queries much easier

    - added path name to error messages in @ref Qore::Dir "Dir" class exception strings

    @subsection qore_088_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - fixed a bug where the ?: operator could thrown spurious exceptions when parsing because it would return the type of the initial boolean expression as the return type of the operator
    - fixed a bug where classes with unimplemented inherited abstract variants would sometimes cause runtime exceptions to be thrown when instantiated but should have instead been caught at parse time
    - fixed a parser bug where out-of-line class method definitions could not be defined in a namespace block
    - fixed a bug parsing arguments in parse_uri_query() in the <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module
    - fixed several bugs where parse exceptions could show the wrong source location:
      - with type errors in function calls
      - when resolving global variables
      - in base class constructor arguments
      - for empty blocks with a missing return statement
      - when validating types used with the return statement (also associated warnings)
      - in methods calls
      - in hash value expressions
      - with redeclaring local variable return types
      - in local variable object instantiations
    - really fixed the bug thought to be fixed in 0.8.7 "where SSL errors would cause the affected thread to go into a infinite loop using 100% CPU" - this turned out to be easily reproducible on all platforms; when the SSL connection was shut down cleanly by the remote end before a response message was returned, an infinite loop would result
    - fixed a bug where it was impossible to output a single '\' character in regex substitution expressions; '\' was taken as an escape character, and '\\\' was output literally, now '\\\' is output as '\'
    - fixed a bug where a parse-time crash would occur when calling the copy() method for a class that does not implement an explicit copy() method
    - fixed a bug where arguments passed to a copy method were ignored; now an exception is thrown
    - fixed a bug where public members and static variables of privately-inherited classes were incorrectly treated as public attributes of the child class
    - fixed a bug where slices could be made of objects from outside the class including private members
    - fixed a bug where @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement::memberGate() "memberGate() methods" were not being respected when taking a slice of an object
    - fixed bugs in the integer Socket::recv*() methods where a \c SOCKET-CLOSED exception was not thrown when the remote end closed the connection
    - fixed a bug related to out-of-order parse initialization for functions and methods which resulted in the wrong return type being returned for a method with more than 1 variant where the variant could not be matched at parse time
    - fixed a bug where a non-variable-reference member of an "our" variable declaration list would cause a crash due to passing the incorrect argument in sprintf()
    - fixed sandboxing / protection errors with inherited code; subclasses inheriting code from a parent class with different parse options would cause the child parse options to be used when running the parent class code which caused errors; now parse options are enforced properly on the block level
    - fixed the @ref Qore::RangeIterator "RangeIterator" class; it was still abstract due to a missing @ref Qore::RangeIterator::valid() method
    - fixed a bug where the wrong error was being returned after a connection reset (remote connection close) in sockets with integer recv*() methods which could in some cases lead to an infinite loop
    - fixed a bug where private members of a common base class were not accessible by objects of subclasses sharing the common base class
    - fixed many bugs in <a href="../../modules/CsvUtil/html/index.html">CsvUtil</a> and updated the module version to 1.1
    - initialize static openssl crypto locks for multi-threaded openssl library access; without this crashes can result (for example in error queue management)
    - fixed a bug where Qore::HTTPClient::getURL() returned an invalid URL when no URL was set; now it returns @ref nothing in this case
    - fixed a bug managing feature/module lists in inherited @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects; user modules were listed in the child @ref Qore::Program "Program" object even though user module code is not imported in child @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects
    - fixed a bug where an invalid guard condition in critical lvalue storage code can cause unreferenced data to be returned while in a lock which can cause a crash in a multithreaded program
    - fixed a bug where references were not being written to the output variable if an exception was active when the code block exited
    - fixed a bug setting the precision for arbitrary-precision numbers with large exponents (like "1e100n")
    - implemented more strict adherence to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> (HTTP 1.1) regarding message-body handling in requests and response message generation and parsing
    - fixed a bug with @ref Qore::Thread::Condition::wait() "Condition::wait()" on Darwin with negative timeout values where a short timeout was used instead of an indefinite wait
    - fixed bugs in the <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> and <a href="../../modules/MailMessage/html/index.html">MailMessage</a> modules where mail messages were being serialized incorrectly if there were no attachments (there was no possibility to set the content transfer encoding) and also where it was not possible to set the content-type for the message body when it was sent as a part of a multipart message
    - fixed bugs handling arguments declared as type @ref reference_or_nothing_type "*reference" (reference or nothing)
    - fixed bugs in executing code accross @ref Qore::Program "Program" object barriers with reference arguments
    - fixed a bug with the switch statement where character encoding differences would cause strings to mismatch even if they were otherwise identical; now hard comparisons with strings allow for implicit automatic temporary character encoding conversions for the comparison
    - fixed a bug where qore failed to set the time zone region correctly when set from /etc/localtime and this file is a relative symlink rather than absolute
    - fixed a bug where substr() and <string>::substr() were returning @ref nothing if the arguments could not be satisifed contrary to the documentation and the declared return type, now an empty string is returned in those cases
    - fixed bugs rounding number values between 10 and -10 (non-inclusive) for display, fixed bugs rounding number value regarding digits after the decimal point for display with @ref Qore::NF_Scientific
    - fixed a bug in the @ref Qore::Dir class where it was not possible to chdir to the root directory \c "/"
    - fixed a bug where recursive references were allowed and memory leaks would occur due to recursive references; these are now caught at runtime and a \c REFERENCE-ERROR exception is thrown
    - fixed a configure bug with bison >= 3
    - fixed a bug in the <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module when automatically uncompressing supported content-encodings to set the resulting string's character encoding correctly
    - fixed a bug in the @ref instanceof "instanceof" operator when working with objects and classes created from different source @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects
    - fixed a bug in *printf() formatting with floating-point and number values where no digits were displayed right of the decimal point unless a specific number of digits was specified in the format string
    - fixed the return type of <bool>::typeCode(); was returning a boolean instead of @ref Qore::NT_BOOLEAN
    - fixed a bug there @ref null was evaluated as @ref Qore::True "True" in a boolean context rather than @ref Qore::False "False"
    - fixed a bug where @ref Qore::Socket::recvBinary() would ignore the first data read
    - fixed starting listeners on UNIX domain sockets on Soalris in the <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module
    - fixed a bug where number("") was being converted to \@NaN\@n
    - fixed return type of @ref Qore::HTTPClient::getConnectionPath() "HTTPClient::getConnectionPath()"
    - fixed several bugs with logical comparison operators and arbitrary-precision numeric values where arbitrary-precision numeric values were not being prioritized as numeric values and also in some cases were being first converted to doubles and then operated on
    - fixed a bug in the socket code where the socket close condition was not flagged with SSL connections when writes failed due to the remote end closing the connection; an error would only be raised on the following socket operation
    - fixed a mismatched delete/malloc error with time zone initialization and the localtime file

    @section qore_087 Qore 0.8.7

    @par Release Summary
    Code embedding improvements

    @subsection qore_087_compatibility Changes That Can Affect Backwards-Compatibility
    @par Fixes for Code Inheritance in Program Objects
    The following changes are meant to sanitize code inheritance in child @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects to fix long-standing design bugs in code encapsulation by addressing the lack of fine-grained control over symbol visibility in inherited code.
    - @ref mod_public "public": The @ref mod_public "public" keyword's usage in modules has now been expanded 
      to provide the same functionality generically in @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects; if @ref qore_classes "classes",
      @ref constants "constants", @ref qore_namespaces "namespaces", @ref qore_functions "functions", or 
      @ref global_variables "global variables" are defined with the @ref mod_public "public" keyword, then these symbols will
      be inherited into child @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects as long as no @ref parse_options "parse options" prohibit
      it.\n\n
      This change was made to give programmers complete control over which symbols are inherited in child
      @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects, whereas because prior to this change, the control was very course.\n\n
    - the default behavior of %Qore regarding inherting global variables and functions with user variants was changed to be
      consistent with namespaces, classes, and constants; that is; public symbols are inherited by default.\n\n
      The following constants were renamed:
      - <tt>PO_INHERIT_USER_FUNC_VARIANTS</tt> is now: @ref Qore::PO_NO_INHERIT_USER_FUNC_VARIANTS "PO_NO_INHERIT_USER_FUNC_VARIANTS"
      - <tt>PO_INHERIT_GLOBAL_VARS</tt> is now: @ref Qore::PO_NO_INHERIT_GLOBAL_VARS "PO_NO_INHERIT_GLOBAL_VARS"\n\n
      This change was made to fix a long-standing design problem with symbol inheritance and make the implementation consistent.\n\n
    - builtin symbols are no longer inherited from user modules; only independent user symbols; the main change is that if a user
      module adds new user methods to a builtin class or new user variants to a builtin function, these changes are no longer imported
      into target @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects.

    @par File Method Changes
    The following methods were updated to throw exceptions on all errors rather than a return code for I/O errors in order to avoid hard to debug conditions due to ignoring I/O errors by forgetting to check the return value on the following methods:
    - Qore::File::f_printf()
    - Qore::File::f_vprintf()
    - Qore::File::print()
    - Qore::File::printf()
    - Qore::File::vprintf()
    - Qore::File::write()
    - Qore::File::writei1()
    - Qore::File::writei2()
    - Qore::File::writei4()
    - Qore::File::writei8()
    - Qore::File::writei2LSB()
    - Qore::File::writei4LSB()
    - Qore::File::writei8LSB()
    .
    Note that the above changes will hopefully only minimally impact backwards-compatibilty since the change is in error handling, and additionally each of the above methods could also throw an exception if called when the object was not open.

    @subsection qore_087_new_features New Features in Qore
    - new methods offering code encapsulation enhancements
      - @ref Qore::Program::loadModule() "Program::loadModule()": allows modules to be loaded in a @ref Qore::Program "Program" object directly
      - @ref Qore::Program::importClass() "Program::importClass()": allows classes to be individually imported in @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects
    - new pseudo-methods in @ref Qore::zzz8nothingzzz9 to allow for @ref Qore::zzz8hashzzz9 pseudo-methods to be safely used with @ref nothing
      - <nothing>::firstKey()
      - <nothing>::firstValue()
      - <nothing>::hasKey()
      - <nothing>::hasKeyValue()
      - <nothing>::keys()
      - <nothing>::lastKey()
      - <nothing>::lastValue()
      - <nothing>::values()
    - other new pseudo-methods:
     - <date>::durationSeconds()
     - <date>::durationMilliseconds()
     - <date>::durationMicroseconds()
    - removed most restrictions on embedded logic in user modules; user module @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects are subject to the
      same restrictions as the parent @ref Qore::Program "Program" object (if any)
    - added the get_parse_options() function so that parse options in the current @ref Qore::Program "Program" can be determined at
      runtime
    - added the get_ex_pos() function to help with formatting exception locations where the \c source and \c offset information is present
    - new methods and method variants:
      - @ref Qore::HTTPClient::getPeerInfo()
      - @ref Qore::HTTPClient::getSocketInfo()
      - @ref Qore::File::getTerminalAttributes()
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::transactionTid()
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::currentThreadInTransaction()
      - @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::currentThreadInTransaction()
    - new location tags \c "source" and \c "offset" added for parse and runtime exceptions to allow for error-reporting to display information about files where sections of a source file are parsed; this allows both the label and line offset in the label and the file name and absolute file line position to be reported in exception information
      - new parameters added to the following methods and function to accommodate the new location information:
        - @ref Qore::Program::parse() "Program::parse()"
	- @ref Qore::Program::parsePending() "Program::parsePending()" 
	- @ref Qore::parse() "parse()"
      - see @ref exception_hash "Exception Hash" and @ref callstack "Call Stacks" for new keys in eception and call stack information hashes
    - <date>::format() now accepts \c "us" for microseconds (see @ref date_formatting)
    - <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> module improvements:
      - added automatic recognition and support of the \c "STARTTLS" command when connecting to an ESMTP server; this way
        the class will automatically upgrade the connection to a secure TLS/SSL connection if the server supports it
      - added support for SMTP server schemes in the URL in the constructor (ex: \c "esmtptls://user@password:smtp.example.com")
      - added support for the deprecated (but still in use) \c "smtps" scheme with a default port of 465
      - when throwing an exception when a Message cannot be sent because it is incomplete, the reason for the error is also included
        in the exception (previously the exception message was generic making problems with the Message object harder to debug)
    - C++ API Enhancements
      - added C++ APIs to allow for %Qore @ref Qore::File "File" and @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue" object arguments to be used by modules
      - added C++ APIs for controlling openssl initialization and cleanup by the qore library
      - extended qpp to allow for parsing relative dates in qpp code for assignments/default argument values
      - made it possible to call the C++ function QoreFunction::findVariant() from threads where there is no current QoreProgram object
        (such as from a thread created by foreign code)
      - added APIs to allow foreign threads to be registered/deregistered as %Qore threads (for example, to allow %Qore code to be called
        in a callback in a foreign thread created by a library linked with a %Qore binary module)
      - added APIs to allow for TID reservations to allow (for example) for a callback that is executed in the same foreign thread to always have the same TID
      - the old Datasource::execRaw() function with the \a args parameter was deprecated since args was ignored anyway, a new Datasource::execRaw() function was added that has no args parammeter

    @subsection qore_087_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - fixed a runtime class matching bug when identical user classes were created in different @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects,
      the match could fail at runtime because the wrong APIs were being used
    - fixed a crashing bug in the @ref map "map" operator with a select expression when used with an 
      @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" object for the list operand
    - fixed a bug where the generation of internal strings for abstract method signatures tries to resolve class names that
      are declared out of order, which incorrectly resulted in a parse exception; the fix is to use the class name in the
      signature before class resolution; the class is resolved in the second stage of parsing (symbol resolution) anyway, if it
      can't be resolved then the changes to the @ref Qore::Program "Program" are rolled back anyway
    - a potential deadlock was fixed when calling @ref Qore::exit() "exit()" while background threads were running; it was
      possible for a thread to be canceled while holding a @ref Qore::Thread::Mutex "Mutex" (for example) and then for another
      thread to deadlock trying to acquire the @ref Qore::Thread::Mutex "Mutex" and therefore for the process to deadlock because
      pthread_mutex_lock() is not a cancellation point. The solution was to cancel all threads first, then wait half a second, then call exit()
    - fixed a bug where global variables were being evaluated with strict mathematical boolean evaluation even when @ref perl-bool-eval
      "%perl-bool-eval" was enabled (which is the default)
    - fixed bug in @ref Qore::parseBase64String() and @ref Qore::parseBase64StringToString() when called with an empty string argument; in this case uninitialized memory was returned
    - fixed runtime dynamic memory leaks in the @ref select and @ref map operators when used with iterators
    - do thread-specific cleanup in the main thread when cleaning up/shutting down the qore library
    - added additional openssl cleanup code for thread-local data and when cleaning up the qore library
    - fixed a bug matching function/method variants at runtime
    - fixed a race condition deleting global dynamic handlers in the <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a> module
    - fixed a bug where declaring an abstract method with parameters and then declaring a concrete reimplementation of the method in a child class with no parameters caused a parse-time crash
    - fixed a bug where trying to dynamically call a function that does not exist results in a deadlock due to an error where a mutex is not unlocked
    - fixed a bug in the @ref Qore::Socket::sendHTTPMessage() and @ref Qore::Socket::sendHTTPResponse() methods regarding the timeout parameter
    - fixed a bug in an socket SSL error message where the method name was printed from non-string memory (used wrong ptr for the <tt>%%s</tt> format argument)
    - fixed some major crashing bugs related to reference handling; a global variable assigned a reference to a reference to a local variable would cause a crash
    - @ref reference_type and @ref reference_or_nothing_type type fixes: an error in @ref reference_type type handling allowed non-reference values to be passed to builtin code expecing references which caused a crash; the @ref reference_type and @ref reference_or_nothing_type types would accept any value type
    - attempted to fix a non-reproducible bug seen on rhel5 in the @ref Qore::Socket "Socket class" where SSL errors would cause the affected thread to go into a infinite loop using 100% CPU

    @par Release Summary
    Iterator improvements and design fixes

    @subsection qore_0862_compatibility Changes That Can Affect Backwards-Compatibility
    @par Fixes for Iterator Class Design Bugs
    Iterators, particular regarding the @ref map "map" and @ref select "select" operators, were implemented in a confusing and inconsistent way; even the %qore documentation was incorrect, and examples were given incorrectly.  The following changes will break functionality using the badly-implemented behavior of iterators before, but since the fix comes fairly soon after the introduction, hopefully this change will not cause too many problems with existing code.   All users polled about the iterator changes in this release saw them as positive and desired changes to the language.
    - the @ref map "map" and @ref select "select" operators' behavior was changed when used with an @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" object for the list operand; now the implied argument is the result of @ref Qore::AbstractIterator::getValue() "AbstractIterator::getValue()" instead of the iterator object itself.  This addresses a confusing design choice in the original iterator integration with the @ref map "map" and @ref select "select" operators
    - the second boolean argument was removed from the @ref Qore::HashIterator::constructor(hash) "HashIterator::constructor(hash)" and @ref Qore::HashReverseIterator::constructor(hash) "HashReverseIterator::constructor(hash)" methods; use the new  @ref Qore::HashPairIterator "HashPairIterator" and @ref Qore::ObjectPairIterator "ObjectPairIterator" classes instead (<hash>::pairIterator() and <object>::pairIterator())
    - the single boolean argument was removed from <hash>::iterator() and <object>::iterator(); use <hash>::pairIterator() and <object>::pairIterator() instead to get the old behavior

    @subsection qore_0862_changes Changes in Qore
    - new iterator classes:
      - @ref Qore::HashKeyIterator "HashKeyIterator"
      - @ref Qore::HashKeyReverseIterator "HashKeyReverseIterator"
      - @ref Qore::HashPairIterator "HashPairIterator"
      - @ref Qore::HashPairReverseIterator "HashPairReverseIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ObjectKeyIterator "ObjectKeyIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ObjectKeyReverseIterator "ObjectKeyReverseIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ObjectPairIterator "ObjectPairIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ObjectPairReverseIterator "ObjectPairReverseIterator"
    - new pseudo-methods:
      - <hash>::keyIterator()
      - <hash>::pairIterator()
      - <hash>::contextIterator()
      - <object>::keyIterator()
      - <object>::pairIterator()
      - <nothing>::keyIterator()
      - <nothing>::pairIterator()
      - <nothing>::contextIterator()
    - the internal C++ QoreProgramHelper object has been updated to wait until all background threads in the %Qore library have executed before taking the @ref Qore::Program "Program" object out of scope; this allows for callbacks and other code that might be needed by background threads started in user modules (for example) to stay valid until the threads in the user modules also have terminated.  Note that this does not affect the case when using @ref exec-class "%exec-class" and an application program object goes out of scope with background threads in user modules having non-static method call references as callbacks to the application program; see @ref user_module_program_scope for more information on this topic.

      - fixed a bug setting the content-type of message parts (this fix is now in the <a href="../../modules/Mime/html/index.html">Mime.qm</a> in the MultiPartMessage::getMsgAndHeaders() method
      - fixed multipart message parsing by using MultiPartMessage::parseBody() in the <a href="../../modules/Mime/html/index.html">Mime.qm</a> module; now also parts with subparts are parsed correctly as well
      - fixed a bug where the sender and from values were not being set properly when parsing email messages
      - updated module to v1.0.3

    @section qore_086 Qore 0.8.6

    @par Release Summary
    Major new features and a few bug fixes

    @subsection qore_086_compatibility Changes That Can Affect Backwards-Compatibility

    @par Perl-Style Boolean Evaluation
    %Qore's default boolean evaluation mode was changed from strict mathematical to a more intuitive perl- (and Python-) like style.
    This change was implemented to address one of the oldest design bugs in %Qore: strict mathematical boolean evaluation.  See @ref perl-bool-eval "%perl-bool-eval" for a description of the new default boolean evaluation mode.\n\n
    To get the old strict mathematical boolean evaluation, use the @ref strict-bool-eval "%strict-bool-eval" parse option.\n\n
    An example of the change; now the following @ref if "if statement" block will be executed as the <tt><b>if</b></tt> expression is now evaluated as @ref Qore::True "True":
    @code
    my string $str = "hello";
    if ($str)
        printf("Qore says hello\n");
    @endcode
    Previously (i.e. with @ref strict-bool-eval "%strict-bool-eval") the <tt><b>if</b></tt> expression above would be evaluated as @ref Qore::False "False" because the string value was converted to an integer 0, however as of %Qore 0.8.6 (with the default @ref perl-bool-eval "perl-bool-eval") it is @ref Qore::True "True" since the string is not empty; empty strings and string value \c "0" are evaluated as @ref Qore::False "False".\n\n
    Perhaps counterintuitively (and the reason this was changed to be the default in qore), the chance for regression errors in
    qore code is very small, because for all cases where the old logic could be applied (meaning excluding cases where the result
    was always @ref Qore::False "False" due to the data types or values being evaluated), the results are the same with the new logic,
    except for one case; the case where a string has more than one character and begins with a zero (ex: \c "00").
    In this case, the old logic would always return @ref Qore::False "False", because the value was first converted to an integer \c 0,
    whereas the new logic will return @ref Qore::True "True".  Note that in the case of a string with a single \c "0", both the old and
    new boolean logic returns @ref Qore::False "False".\n\n
    Basically with this option set, qore's boolean evaluation becomes like perl's and Python's, whereas any expression that has the following values is @ref Qore::False "False": @ref nothing, @ref string "string" \c "0" and @ref string "empty strings", @ref integer "integer", @ref float "float", and @ref number "number" \c 0 (zero), @ref absolute_dates "absolute date" \c 1970-01-01Z (ie the start of the epoch with an offset of 0), @ref relative_dates "relative date" \c 0s (or any  @ref relative_dates "relative date" with a 0 duration), @ref null, @ref binary "empty binary objects", @ref hash "empty hashes", and @ref list "empty lists".  All other values are @ref Qore::True "True".
    @note also affects the @ref Qore::boolean(any) "boolean(any)" function

    @par Changes in the Socket Class
    The @ref Qore::Socket "Socket" class was enhanced to support timeouts with non-blocking I/O on all send operations; 
    many Socket methods that send data were originally implemented to return an error code on error, however they would
    also throw exceptions if the socket were not open, so the error handling was inconsistent (exceptions versus return codes).\n\n
    Additionally it was not possible to get error information at all for SSL errors if the socket was connected with SSL, which,
    according to %Qore's socket design, should be transparent for the programmer.\n\n
    For these reasons the implementation was deemed inconsistent and unintuitive; the change was to add optional timeout parameters
    to all send methods and to allow the methods to throw exceptions (instead of simply returning -1 and not being able to determine the cause of the error in many cases).\n\n
    The following methods were updated to accept optional timeout parameters and throw exceptions on all errors rather than a return code for I/O errors:
    - Qore::Socket::send()
    - Qore::Socket::sendBinary()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi1()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi2()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi4()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi8()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi2LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi4LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::sendi8LSB()

    @par New Abstract Method in AbstractIterator
    The following abstract method was added:
    - Qore::AbstractIterator::valid() was added (with concrete implementations in all iterator classes derived from this base class delivered with %Qore); this method tells if the object is currently pointing to a valid iterator.\n\n For any user classes inherting @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" directly (as opposed to another concrete iterator class in %Qore, where the method has already been added), a concrete implementation of this method will have to be added as well or that class will become @ref abstract with this release of %Qore.

    @subsection qore_086_new_features New Features in Qore
    @par Arbitrary-Precision Numeric Support
    %Qore now uses the <a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a> and <a href="http://gmplib.org">GMP</a> libraries to provide arbitrary-precision numeric support.  This type can be used for high-precision mathematics or for storing \c NUMERIC (ie \c DECIMAL or \c NUMBER) column values when retrieved from databases by %Qore DBI drivers that support the new capability @ref Qore::SQL::DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT "DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT" (previously these values would be retrieved as %Qore strings in order to avoid information loss).\n\n
    For more information, see the new @ref number "number" type, @ref number_type, and @ref Qore::zzz8numberzzz9

    @par New CsvUtil Module
    The <a href="../../modules/CsvUtil/html/index.html">CsvUtil</a> module implements the CsvFileIterator class that allows for easy parsing of csv-like text files

    @par %%try-module Parse Directive to Handle Module Load Errors at Parse Time
    The new @ref try-module "%try-module" parse directive allows for module load errors to be handled at parse time; ex:
    @code
%try-module($ex) some-module > 1.0
    printf("error loading module %y: %s: %s\n", $ex.arg, $ex.err, $ex.desc);
    exit(1);
%endtry
    @endcode

    @par Abstract Class Hierarchy Improvement
    As of this version of qore, concrete implementations of @ref abstract "abstract methods" no longer have to have exactly the same return type as the abstract method; it is now sufficient that the return type in the concrete method meets a compatibility test with the return type of the abstract method in the parent class.\n\n
    For example the following is now valid (and <tt>MyConcreteClass</tt> is not abstract, whereas previously because the return types in the child class were not exact, <tt>MyConcreteClass</tt> would be considered abstract by qore):
    @code
class MyAbstractClass {
    abstract any doSomething();
    abstract *string getString();
}

class MyConcreteClass inherits MyAbstractClass {
    int doSomething() {
        return 1;
    }
    string getString() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
    @endcode    

    @par DBI Improvements
    Three new DBI capabilities were implemented, including a new option API as follows:
    - @ref Qore::SQL::DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT "DBI_CAP_HAS_NUMBER_SUPPORT": DBI drivers declaring this capability can accept @ref number "number" values and can also return @ref number "number" values, if a DBI driver does not declare this capability, then @ref number "number" values sent for binding by value are automatically converted to @ref float "float" values before being sent to the driver
    - @ref Qore::SQL::DBI_CAP_HAS_OPTION_SUPPORT "DBI_CAP_HAS_OPTION_SUPPORT": this indicates that the driver supports the new option API, allowing options to be set on each connection.  See the following for more information:
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::constructor() "Datasource::constructor(hash)": now passes options to the DBI driver if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::constructor() "Datasource::constructor(string)": (new in 0.8.6) passes options to the DBI driver if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::getOption(string) "Datasource::getOption(string)": (new in 0.8.6) returns the value of the given option if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::getOptionHash() "Datasource::getOptionHash()": (new in 0.8.6) returns a hash of the current option values for the current connection if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::setOption() "Datasource::setOption()": (new in 0.8.6) allows options to be changed after the object is created
      - @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::constructor() "DatasourcePool::constructor(hash)": now passes options to the DBI driver if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::constructor() "DatasourcePool::constructor(string)": (new in 0.8.6) passes options to the DBI driver if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::getOption(string) "DatasourcePool::getOption(string)": (new in 0.8.6) returns the value of the given option if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::getOptionHash() "DatasourcePool::getOptionHash()": (new in 0.8.6) returns a hash of the current option values for the current connection if the driver supports the option API
      - @ref Qore::SQL::dbi_get_driver_options(string) "dbi_get_driver_options(string)": (new in 0.8.6) returns a hash of driver option information without values
    - @ref Qore::SQL::DBI_CAP_SERVER_TIME_ZONE "DBI_CAP_SERVER_TIME_ZONE": indicates that the DBI driver will convert any bound date/time values to the server's time zone before binding and also will tag date/time values retrieved from the server with the server's time zone.  This capability also implies that the driver supports the new \c "timezone" option.

    @par Socket Improvements
    The @ref Qore::Socket "Socket" class was updated to support non-blocking I/O on all send methods; the following methods were updated to accept optional timeout parameters:
    - Qore::Socket::send2()
    - Qore::Socket::sendBinary2()
    - Qore::Socket::sendHTTPMessage()
    - Qore::Socket::sendHTTPResponse()
    .
    The following methods were enhanced to provide better error information when throwing exceptions:
    - Qore::Socket::recvi1()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi2()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi4()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi8()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi2LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi4LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::recvi8LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::recvu1()
    - Qore::Socket::recvu2()
    - Qore::Socket::recvu4()
    - Qore::Socket::recvu2LSB()
    - Qore::Socket::recvu4LSB()

    @par Iterator Improvements
    The following improvements were made in qore to support more flexible and ubiquitous iterators:
    - new iterator classes:
      - @ref Qore::SingleValueIterator "SingleValueIterator": allows single values (or any value without an iterator class) to be iterated; this provides the basis for the return type for the new base <value>::iterator() method for non-container types
      - @ref Qore::FileLineIterator "FileLineIterator": allows files to be iterated line by line
      - @ref Qore::ObjectIterator "ObjectIterator": a generic iterator for objects
      - @ref Qore::ObjectReverseIterator "ObjectReverseIterator": a generic reverse iterator for objects
      - @ref Qore::RangeIterator "RangeIterator": a numerical sequence generator (the basis for the return type for the new @ref Qore::xrange() "xrange()" function
    - new pseudo-methods were added to return iterator objects based on the value type:
      - <value>::iterator()
      - <hash>::iterator()
      - <list>::iterator()
      - <object>::iterator()
      .
      The base pseudo-method (<value>::iterator()) ensures that any value can be iterated, and the type-specific methods ensure that the most suitable iterator for container types is returned for container values; values without an iterator class are iterated with the @ref Qore::SingleValueIterator "SingleValueIterator"
    - the @ref Qore::HashIterator "HashIterator" and @ref Qore::HashReverseIterator "HashReverseIterator" classes had an additional optional boolean argument added to their constructors; if @ref Qore::True "True", then the @ref Qore::HashIterator::getValue() "HashIterator::getValue()" and @ref Qore::HashReverseIterator::getValue() "HashReverseIterator::getValue()" methods return a hash with the following keys: \c "key" and \c "value", allowing for more convenient iteration with constructions that only use \c getValue() methods (such as the @ref foreach "foreach statement"); to accommodate this, two new methods were added to the @ref Qore::HashIterator "HashIterator" base class:
      - @ref Qore::HashIterator::getKeyValue()
      - @ref Qore::HashIterator::getValuePair()
    - all iterator classes had copy methods added to them (ex: @ref Qore::HashIterator::copy())
    - new Python-inspired @ref Qore::range() "range()" and @ref Qore::xrange() "xrange()" functions (the latter returning a @ref Qore::RangeIterator "RangeIterator" object to efficiently iterate large integral sequences or ranges
 
    @par Text File Parsing Enhancements
    The following improvements were made in qore to support more flexible file parsing:
    - the @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile class was added as a parent class of @ref Qore::File to allow for a more convenient API for reading files (the @ref Qore::File class's API remains the same as it publically inherits  @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile)
    - the @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile::readLine() "ReadOnlyFile::readLine()" method (formerlly a method of the @ref Qore::File class) was enhanced to accept 2 optional arguments, allowing the end of line character(s) to be stripped from the line returned, and also to allow the end of line characters to be specified.  If no end of line characters are specified, then the method automatically determines the end of line characters (can be \c "\n", \c "\r", or \c "\r\n"; the last one only if the underlying file is not a TTY in order to avoid stalling I/O on an interactive TTY)
    - the @ref file_stat_constants were moved from the @ref Qore::File class to the @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile class
    - added a new @ref Qore::FileLineIterator "FileLineIterator" iterator class
    - added a new optional parameter to <string>::split(string, string, bool) and Qore::split(string, string, string, bool) to allow for automatic stripping unquoted fields of leading and trailing whitespace (the default is the old behavior; i.e. leave the whitespace as it is read)
    - added a new @ref Qore::TimeZone "TimeZone" method for parsing string dates in a specific @ref Qore::TimeZone "TimeZone": @ref Qore::TimeZone::date(string, string)
    - added a new function for parsing text as a boolean value: @ref Qore::parse_boolean() "parse_boolean()"
    - as mentioned above, the new <a href="../../modules/CsvUtil/html/index.html">CsvUtil</a> module was added, implementing the CsvFileIterator class that allows for easy parsing of csv-like text files

    @par Other Improvements and Changes
    - the @ref foreach "foreach statement" now iterates objects derived from @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" automatically
    - added a @ref Qore::Option::HAVE_SYMLINK "HAVE_SYMLINK" constant for the symlink() function added in qore 0.8.5
    - added the @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement::memberGate() "SQLStatement::memberGate()" method so @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement "SQLStatement" objects can be dereferenced directly to a column value when iterated with @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement::next() "SQLStatement::next()"; also this method will throw exceptions when an unknown column name is used so that typos in column names can be caught (instead of being silently ignored producing hard to find bugs)
    - implemented @ref Qore::SQL::Datasource::constructor(string) "Datasource::constructor(string)" and @ref Qore::SQL::DatasourcePool::constructor(string) "DatasourcePool::constructor(string)" variants to allow for creating datasources from a string that can be parsed by Qore::SQL::parse_datasource(string) "parse_datasource(string)"
    - added the following new DBI-related functions:
      - @ref Qore::SQL::dbi_get_driver_list() "dbi_get_driver_list()"
      - @ref Qore::SQL::dbi_get_driver_capability_list(string) "dbi_get_driver_capability_list(string)"
      - @ref Qore::SQL::dbi_get_driver_capabilities(string) "dbi_get_driver_capabilities(string)"
      - @ref Qore::SQL::dbi_get_driver_options(string) "dbi_get_driver_options(string)"
      - @ref Qore::SQL::parse_datasource(string) "parse_datasource(string)"
    - implemented support for \c "A" and \c "a", (hexadecimal floating-point output) \c "G", \c "g", (compact floating-point output) \c "F", (non-scientific floating-point output) and \c "E" and \c "e" (scientific/exponential floating-point output) format arguments for @ref float "floats" and @ref number "numbers" (new arbitrary-precision @ref number "number type values"); see @ref string_formatting
    - new pseudo-methods:
      - <value>::toString()
      - <value>::toInt()
      - <value>::toFloat()
      - <value>::toBool()
      - <float>::format(string fmt)
      - <int>::format(string fmt)
      - <string>::isDataAscii()
      - <string>::isDataPrintableAscii()
      - <value>::callp()
      - <callref>::callp()
      - <int>::sign()
      - <float>::sign()
    - the value of the @ref Qore::SQL::NUMBER "NUMBER", @ref Qore::SQL::NUMERIC "NUMERIC", and @ref Qore::SQL::DECIMAL "DECIMAL" @ref sql_constants is now \c "number" instead of \c "string" (see also @ref sql_binding)
    - new constants:
      - @ref Qore::M_PIn "M_PIn"
      - @ref Qore::MAXINT "MAXINT"
      - @ref Qore::MININT "MININT"
    - new functions:
      - @ref Qore::range() "range()"
      - @ref Qore::xrange() "xrange()"
    - new methods:
      - @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile::isTty() and @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile::getFileName() (the @ref Qore::ReadOnlyFile class was added in qore 0.8.6 otherwise made up of methods formerly belonging to the @ref Qore::File class)
    - added the @ref append-module-path "%append-module-path" parse directive
    - @ref user_modules "user modules" may now use @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects for embedded logic; any @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects created in a @ref user_modules "user module" will have its parse options masked to be not less restrictive than the parse options in the current @ref Qore::Program "Program", and additionally parse options will be locked so that user module are not able to circumvent function restrictions imposed by parse options.
    - updated docs to show functional restrictions tagged at the class level

    @subsection qore_086_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore

    - @ref Qore::File::constructor() "File::constructor()" now throws an exception if called with a tty target and @ref no-terminal-io "%no-terminal-io" is set
    - fixed a bug in split with quote (<string>::split(string, string, bool) and Qore::split(string, string, string, bool)) if the separator pattern was not found and the single field was not quoted either
    - fixed a bug handling nested @ref ifdef "%ifdef" and @ref ifndef "%ifndef" blocks with @ref else "%else" in the inside block
    - fixed a crashing due to the failure to clear the "PF_TOP_LEVEL" flag when initializing statements, this could cause temporary variables in a statement to be marked as the start of the global thread-local variable list, and then after such variables are deleted, then a crash happens when trying to access the global thread-local variable list
    - fixed a crashing bug at parse time merging function lists in namespaces declared multiple times
    - fixed a bug in executing user module init() closures
    - fixed a bug where the qore library could crash when destroying a Program object due to a race condition in removing signal handlers managed by the Program object; the Program calls the signal handler manager to remove the signals, but the signals can be removed concurrently to the request while the Program object is iterating the signal set (ie it is modified while being iterated), which causes a crash
    - added code to detect when the same namespace is declared both with and without the @ref mod_public "public keyword" when defining user modules which can result in entire namespaces being silently not exported (and can be difficult to debug); now a parse exception is thrown if this happens while parsing a user module
    - added code tags to @ref Qore::File "File" methods without side effects
    - made many minor documentation fixes

    @section qore_085 Qore 0.8.5

    @par Release Summary
    Major new features and a few bug fixes

    @subsection qore_085_new_features New Features in Qore
    @par Abstract Methods and Interfaces
    %Qore now supports the <b>abstract</b> keyword when declaring methods; an <b>abstract</b> method has no implementation and must be
    implemented in child classes with the same signature for the child class to be instantiated.\n\n
    Classes with <b>abstract</b> methods define interfaces; a concrete implementation of the interface is a class that inherits the class with <b>abstract</b> methods and implements all the <b>abstract</b> methods.\n\n
    Abstract methods are defined with the following syntax:
    @code
class MyAbstractInterface {
    abstract string doSomething(int $param);
    abstract bool checkSomething(string $arg);
}
    @endcode
    The following abstract classes now exist in %Qore:
    - @ref Qore::SQL::AbstractDatasource "AbstractDatasource"
    - @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator"
      - @ref Qore::AbstractQuantifiedIterator "AbstractQuantifiedIterator"
      - @ref Qore::AbstractBidirectionalIterator "AbstractBidirectionalIterator"
      - @ref Qore::AbstractQuantifiedBidirectionalIterator "AbstractQuantifiedBidirectionalIterator"
    - @ref Qore::Thread::AbstractSmartLock "AbstractSmartLock" (which was already present in %Qore but now implements abstract methods)
    .
    The following new iterator classes have been added to %Qore:
    - @ref Qore::HashIterator "HashIterator"
      - @ref Qore::HashReverseIterator "HashReverseIterator"
    - @ref Qore::HashListIterator "HashListIterator"
      - @ref Qore::HashListReverseIterator "HashListReverseIterator"
    - @ref Qore::ListHashIterator "ListHashIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ListHashReverseIterator "ListHashReverseIterator"
    - @ref Qore::ListIterator "ListIterator"
      - @ref Qore::ListReverseIterator "ListReverseIterator"
    - @ref Qore::SQL::SQLStatement "SQLStatement" (which was already present in %Qore but now implements the @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" interface to allow query results to be iterated)
    .
    Classes inheriting @ref Qore::AbstractIterator "AbstractIterator" have special support so that objects can be easily iterated in the following list operators:
    - @ref map
    - @ref foldr and @ref foldl
    - @ref select
    .
    @par Universal References
    All restrictions on references have been removed from %Qore; references to local variables may now be passed to the @ref background "background operator" and passed as arguments to @ref closure "closures".\n\n
    Basically when a reference is taken of a local variable that could result in the local variable being accessed in a multi-threaded context, the variable is treated as a closure-bound local variable in the sense that it's lifetime is reference-counted, and all accesses are wrapped in a dedicated mutual-exclusion lock to ensure thread safety.

    @par Pop3Client Module
    A <a href="../../modules/Pop3Client/html/index.html">Pop3Client</a> module has been added providing an API for communicating with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP3</a> servers and retrieving email messages.\n\n
    The module uses functionality provided by the new <a href="../../modules/MailMessage/html/index.html">MailMessage</a> module to represent email messages (and attachment data) downloaded from the server.

    @par MailMessage Module
    The <a href="../../modules/MailMessage/html/index.html">MailMessage</a> module provides common functionality to the <a href="../../modules/Pop3Client/html/index.html">Pop3Client</a> and <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> modules to represent email messages for receiving and sending, respectively.  This module was created mostly from functionality removed from the <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> and enhanced to provide support for reading email messages in the new <a href="../../modules/Pop3Client/html/index.html">Pop3Client</a> module.

    @par SmtpClient Module Changes
    The Message and Attachment classes were removed from the <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> module to the <a href="../../modules/MailMessage/html/index.html">MailMessage</a> module.  Backwards-compatible definitions for the Message and Attachment classes are provided in the <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a> module to rexport the removed functionality for backwards compatibility.

    @par Other Minor Improvements and Changes
    - qpp updated to support abstract methods and multiple inheritance (+ other minor qpp enhancements)
    - improved the \c QOREADDRINFO-GETINFO-ERROR exception description by adding information about the arguments passed
    - added a string argument to @ref Qore::chr(softint, __7_ string) "char(softint, *string)" to accept an output encoding
    - added a @ref Qore::int(string, softint) "int(string, softint)" variant to parse a string as a number and give the base
    - added a new parameter to parse_url() and parseURL() to allow for any [] in the hostname to be included in the \c "host" output key for indicating that the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">ipv6</a> protocol be used
    - added the following pseudo-methods:
      - Qore::zzz8valuezzz9::lsize()
      - Qore::zzz8binaryzzz9::split()
      - Qore::zzz8binaryzzz9::toMD5()
      - Qore::zzz8binaryzzz9::toSHA1()

      - Qore::zzz8listzzz9::first()
      - Qore::zzz8listzzz9::join()
      - Qore::zzz8listzzz9::last()
      - Qore::zzz8listzzz9::lsize()
      - Qore::zzz8nothingzzz9::lsize()
      - Qore::zzz8stringzzz9::regex()

      - Qore::zzz8stringzzz9::toSHA384()
      - Qore::zzz8stringzzz9::toSHA512()
    - added the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xxhash/">xxhash FAST algorithm</a> with unordered_map to %Qore on supported platforms resuling in nearly 2x haster hash lookups
    - added the Qore::File::isOpen() method
    - added the Qore::call_pseudo() function to explicitly call a pseudo method on a value
    - added the Qore::symlink() function to create symbolic links
    - added Qore::TypeCodeMap and Qore::TypeNameMap to lookup type codes from type names and vice versa
    - added the following functions to allow the time zone to be set per thread:
      - Qore::set_thread_tz()
      - Qore::get_thread_tz()

    @subsection qore_085_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - fixed format_date() output for \c "MON" and \c "DAY", etc
    - fixed a memory leak in the parser related to parse exception handling with namespace members
    - fixed an invalid assert() in module handling when an error occurs loading the module (only affected debug builds)
    - tagged digest and crypto functions internally as @ref RET_VALUE_ONLY
    - do not kill TID 1 (the initial / main thread) when calling exit() in background threads as a crash can result with some 3rd party libraries that spawn their own threads on some platforms (observed on Darwin & Solaris 10 at least)
    - fixed a memory bug in the new builtin function API used by modules built with qpp
    - fixed memory bugs in the type system where uninitialized type pointers could be used causing a crash
    - fixed a memory bug in handling "or nothing" types where a non-null pointer would be assumed to be a pointer to the type, however it could actually be a pointer to the NOTHING object, the fix was to ensure that any NOTHING objects in argument lists would be substituted with a null pointer
    - fixed a bug in parse-time variant matching where an argument with parse-time type "object" would be matched as a perfect match to any parameter with any class restriction; this would cause run-time type errors if another valid class was passed that matched another variant of the method or function
    - fixed a build bug that caused qore to be built twice

    @section qore_084 Qore 0.8.4

    @par Release Summary
    Major new features and changes that can affect backwards-compatibility, plus 40 bug fixes

    @subsection qore_084_compatibility Changes That Can Affect Backwards-Compatibility

    @par Namespace Changes
    %Qore's internal namespace handling was nearly completely rewritten for %Qore 0.8.4.  This is because the old code was inefficient and applied namespaces inconsistently to @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects.\n\n
    The main change that can cause backwards-compatibility issues is that now functions are full namespace members.  If no namespace is explicitly given in a function definition, the function is a member of the unnamed root namespace.\n\n
    Also the distinction between builtin and user functions was removed.  Internally, there is only one kind of function object, which can contain both builtin and user function variants (overloaded variants of the same function with the same name but different arguments).\n\n
    All %Qore builtin functions were moved to the Qore namespace.\n\n
    Other namespace changes:
    - loading namespaces provided by builtin modules into a @ref Qore::Program "Program" object is now an atomic operation that may fail, if, for example, objects have already been defined in the target @ref Qore::Program "Program" with the same name as objects provided by the builtin module.  Previously this could cause undefined behavior.
    - namespace lookups are now truly breadth-first as documented; previously the algorithm was depth-first (contrary to the documentation)
    - namespace lookups are now done (both at parse time and runtime) with the help of symbol lookup tables for fast lookups; tables are maintained for both committed and temporary uncomitted parse symbols; this leads to up to 3x faster parsing for %Qore code
    - global variables are also now full namespace members, however this does not cause problems with backwards-compatibility

    @subsection qore_084_new_features New Features in Qore

    @par User Modules
    It is now possible to develop user modules in %Qore; several user modules are now included in the %Qore distribution, forming %Qore-language components of %Qore's runtime library.\n\n
    User modules delivered with %Qore 0.8.4:
    - <a href="../../modules/HttpServer/html/index.html">HttpServer</a>: a multi-threaded HTTP server implementation
    - <a href="../../modules/SmtpClient/html/index.html">SmtpClient</a>: an SMTP client library
    - <a href="../../modules/TelnetClient/html/index.html">TelnetClient</a>: a TELNET client implementation
    - <a href="../../modules/Mime/html/index.html">Mime</a>: a set of MIME definitions and functions for manipulating MIME data
    .
    There are also new example programs for the above modules in the examples/ directory.\n\n
    User modules are subject to %Qore's functional restriction framework.

    @par Namespace Changes
    As listed above:\n
    - global variables and functions are now full namespace members
    - all builtin functions are now in the Qore namespace
    - real depth-first searches are used for namespace symbols
    - symbols are resolved first in the current namespace when parsing declarations/code in a namespace

    @par The <b><tt>final</tt></b> Keyword
    Classes and methods can now be declared "final" to prevent subclassing or overriding in a subclass

    @par Pseudo Methods
    Pseudo-methods are class methods that can be implemented on any value; they are also part of class hierarchy.  The methods that can be executed on the value depend on the value's type, and all "pseudo-classes" inherit methods from a common base class.\n\n
    For example:
    @code
"string".strlen()
<abf05da3>.size()
500.typeCode()
    @endcode
    Are examples of pseudo-methods on literal values.\n\n
    Some expensive operations such as getting the first or last key (or value) of a hash are now cheap using pseudo-methods, for example:
    @code
$hash.firstKey()
$hash.lastValue()
    @endcode

    @par New Doxygen-Based Documentation
    The %Qore reference documentation is now generated by Doxygen, and is generated directly from the %Qore sources.  In fact, a new preprocessor known as "qpp" was developed for %Qore 0.8.4 to facilitate and enforce doxygen documentation on %Qore's runtime library (as well as abstract the relatively complex APIs used to bind C++ code to the %Qore runtime library from the C++ programmer).\n\n
    The documentation is more comprehensive, and corresponds much closer to the actual internal implementation since the documentation is now also contained in and directly generated from the internal C++ implementation of %Qore.\n\n
    For example, there is the <value>::val() method.  This method is implemented in the base pseudo class and is reimplemented in other pseudo-classes for other runtime data types as necessary.  This method returns @ref Qore::True "True" if the value has a value in the same sense as Perl's boolean context evaluation.  For example, if the value is a hash with no keys, it returns @ref Qore::False "False"; if it is a hash with keys, it returns @ref Qore::True "True"; if it is an empty string, it returns @ref Qore::False "False";
if it is a non-empty string, it returns @ref Qore::True "True", etc.

   @par LValue Handling Changes
   lvalue handling was rewritten as the old implementation was ugly and subject to deadlocks (in rare corner cases).\n\n
   Furthermore, medium-term, an architectural goal of %Qore is to store all ints, floats, and bools internally as the basic C++ type instead of using a class wrapper for each value, which needs dynamic allocation and destruction, which takes up more memory and negatively affects execution speed.\n\n
   With %Qore 0.8.4, all local and global variables are stored using optimized C++ types when declared with the appropriate type restrictions; for example:
   @code
my int $i0;
our int $i1;
   @endcode
   These declares local and global variables that can only be assigned integer values; in %Qore 0.8.4 the value internally will be stored as an "int64" value (and not a dynamically-allocated QoreBigIntNode object).\n\n
   The same holds for:
   - @ref int_type "int"
   - @ref softint_type "softint"
   - @ref float_type "float"
   - @ref softfloat_type "softfloat"
   - @ref bool_type "bool"
   - @ref softbool_type "softbool"
   .
   Note that the optimized lvalue handling has not yet been applied to all lvalues, in particular non-static object members with declared types are not yet implemented with optimized storage; to do this requires a rewrite of %Qore's API and ABI (will happen in the next major release of %Qore).\n\n
   This change leads to improved integer and floating-point performance and a smaller runtime memory footprint.

   @par Runtime Optimizations
   In addition to the up to 3x faster parsing (as decribed in the namespace changes above), %Qore 0.8.4 contains many runtime optimizations designed to reduce the number of dynamic memory allocations performed at runtime.\n\n
   The optimizations included in this version of %Qore are only a half-measure compared to future changes that will necessitate a new binary %Qore API.

   @par Per-Thread Initialization
   the new set_thread_init() function allows a call reference or closure to be set which will be automatically executed when new threads are started (or a new thread accesses a @ref Qore::Program "Program" object) which can be used to transparently initialize thread-local data.

   @par More Control Over Thread Resource Exceptions
   new functions:
   - throw_thread_resource_exceptions_to_mark()
   - mark_thread_resources()
   .
   Allow for only thread resouces created after a certain point to be processed (for example only thread resources left after some embedded code was called)

   @par New Socket Methods
   new methods:
   - Qore::Socket::upgradeClientToSSL()
   - Qore::Socket::upgradeServerToSSL()
   .
   Allow upgrading an already-existing socket connection to SSL

   @par Better Socket Error Messages
   More information has been added to socket exceptions to provide better feedback when errors occur.

   @par New Socket Event Fields
   - added \c "type" and \c "typename" keys to the @ref EVENT_HOSTNAME_RESOLVED event
   - added \c "type", \c "typename", and \c "address" keys to the @ref EVENT_CONNECTING event

   @par Support For Blocking Writes in the Queue Class
   @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue" objects can now be used as a blocking message channel (similar to a Go channel); if a maximum size is given to the @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue" constructor, then trying to write data to the @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue" when it is full will block until the @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue"'s size goes below the maximum size; optional timeout parameters have been added to @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue" methods that write to the @ref Qore::Thread::Queue "Queue".

   @par New Queue::clear() Method
   Does just what you think it does :)

   @par date(string, string) Improvement
   added the possibility to specify microseconds when parsing dates against a mask with the date() function

   @par New Support For ++ And -- Operators With Floating-Point Lvalues
   previously this would either convert the lvalue to an int or throw an exception if the lvalue could not be converted to an int due to type restrictions

   @par Class Recognition/Compatibility Between Program Objects
   The problem is that a user class created from the same source code in two different @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects would be recognized as a different class with parameter and variable type restrictions - ie you could not declare a variable or parameter with a class type restrictions and assign it an object created from the same class source code but created in another @ref Qore::Program "Program" object.\n\n
   This problem is analogous to a similar problem with java in that classes built from the same source but from different classloaders are also recognized as different classes.\n\n
   In %Qore 0.8.4 a class signature is created of all public and private objects, and an SHA1 hash is maintained of the class signature, and if the class names and signatures match, then the classes are assumed to be identical, even if they have different internal class IDs (because they were created in different @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects, for example).

   @par New TimeZone::date(string) Method
   to support creating arbitrary dates in a given @ref Qore::TimeZone "TimeZone"

   @par New GetOpt::parse3() method
   This method will display any errors on @ref Qore::stderr "stderr" and exit the program (which is the most typical way of handling command line errors anyway)

   @par += Operator Optimization For object += hash
   this operation is faster in this release

   @par New Parse Option PO_NO_MODULES
   Using this option disables module loading

   @par New Parse Option PO_NO_EMBEDDED_LOGIC
   Using this option disables all dynamic parsing

   @par New Parse Directives
   - @ref assume-global "%assume-global": the opposite of @ref assume-local "%assume-local"
   - @ref old-style "%old-style": the opposite of @ref new-style "%new-style"
   - @ref require-dollar "%require-dollar": the opposite of @ref allow-bare-refs "%allow-bare-refs"
   - @ref push-parse-options "%push-parse-options": allows parse options to be saved and restored when the current file is done parsing; very useful for %include files

   @par New Context Functions
   - cx_value(): returns the value of the given key
   - cx_first(): returns @ref Qore::True "True" if iterating the first row
   - cx_last(): returns @ref Qore::True "True" if iterating the last row
   - cx_pos(): returns the current row number (starting from 0)
   - cx_total(): returns the total number of rows in the set

   @par SOCKET-HTTP-ERROR Exception Enhancement
   The invalid header info received is reported in the exception's \c "arg" key

   @par Improved Parse Error Messages
   Improved some parse error messages dealing with namespace and class declaration errors

   @par Added NT_CLOSURE Constant
   type code for runtime closure values

    @subsection qore_084_bug_fixes Bug Fixes in Qore
    - fixed a race condition with @ref Qore::Program "Program" objects when a signal handler is left active and the @ref Qore::Program "Program" terminates
    - fixed a bug in the @ref Qore::File "File" class where the encoding given in the constructor was ignored; if no encoding was given in the File::open*() method then the @ref Qore::File "File"'s encoding would always be set to the default encoding, now it's set to the encoding given in the constructor (as documented)
    - runtime checks have been implemented so that references to local variables cannot be passed to a closure; this would cause a runtime crash
    - a fix has been made to the @ref delete "delete" and @ref remove "remove" operators; lists will not be extended when trying to remove/delete list elements that do not exist
    - fixed some bugs showing the error location with bugs in the second stage of parsing (symbol resolution)
    - apply type filters to blocks with a designated return type but no @ref return "return statement"
    - fixed crashing bugs on some 32bit platforms where size_t was assumed to be 64 bits
    - fixed a crashing bug parsing invalid @ref requires "%requires" directives in the scanner
    - fixed a bug in usleep() with relative date/time values (added a new usleep() variant to support this)
    - fixed a typo in the command-line help for the qore binary with unknown parse options	  
    - fixed @ref Qore::Option::HAVE_SIGNAL_HANDLING "HAVE_SIGNAL_HANDLING" to be @ref Qore::False "False" if signal handling is disabled on platforms where signal handling is otherwise available
    - fixed a scanner bug parsing out of line class definitions with a root-justified namespace path (ex: \c "class ::X::ClassName ...")
    - merging code from binary modules at parse time and at runtime is now transaction-safe (before it would cause memory errors and/or a crash), now if errors are detected then an exception is raised and changes are not applied.
    - fixed a crashing bug in the C++ API function QoreHashNode::setKeyValue() when the value is 0 and an exception occurs or is already active before the call is made
    - fixed a bug in date parsing with a format string - off by one with integer months - added a regression test for this case
    - fixed a memory error with the @ref rethrow "rethrow statement" in enclosing but nested try-catch blocks
    - fixed a crashing bug where qore would try to instantiate a class for a type that did not represent a class (ex: \c "my int $i();")
    - fixed a memory leak in the @ref softlist_type "softlist" and @ref softlist_or_nothing_type "*softlist" type implementation
    - make sure and raise a \c SOCKET-CLOSED error when reading a HTTP header if no data is received
    - make sure and convert encodings with @ref Qore::index() "index()" and @ref Qore::rindex() "rindex()" functions if the encodings don't match
    - build fix: only use a lib64 directory if the directory exists already
    - raise a parse exception in the scanner if a numeric overflow occurs in literal integer values
    - fixed a bug in @ref Qore::Thread::AbstractSmartLock::lockTID() "AbstractSmartLock::lockTID()"
    - fixed a major crashing error in the C++ API function QoreStringNode::createAndConvertEncoding(); this function is used by the xml module when parsing XML-RPC sent in a non-UTF-8 character encoding
    - fixed Qore::File::getchar() to always retrieve 1 character (even for multi-byte character encodings)
    - fixed string evaluation in a boolean context to return @ref Qore::True "True" with floating-point numbers between -1.0 and 1.0 exclusive
    - printf formatting fix: output YAML-style \c "null" for @ref nothing with %%y
    - scanner fix: accept \c "\r" as whitespace to allow better parsing of sources with Windows EOL markers
    - fixed parse-time type processing/checks for the keys, + and * operators
    - foreach statement fix: unconditionally evaluate the hash when iterating as otherwise it could change during iteration which could cause a crash
    - fixed another parse-time variant matching bug where the variant-matching algorithm was too aggressive and excluded possible matches at parse time which could result in a false parse-time definitive match even though a better match could be available at runtime
    - fixed a static memory leak when signal handlers are left registered when the qore library terminates
    - fixed static memory leaks and 1 dynamic memory leak in strmul()
    - fixed a crashing bug in handling recursive constant references
    - fixed a bug in the C++ API function HashIterator::deleteKey() when the node's value is NULL
    - fixed time zone/DST calculations for time zone regions with DST with dates before the epoch but after the last DST transition before the epoch
    - fixed a memory error where invalid source expressions referenced in a regular expression substitution expression would cause a crash (ex: @verbatim str =~ s/public (name)/$2/g @endverbatim
    - fixed a memory error in regular expression substitution where the unconverted string (if not given in UTF-8 encoding) was used when copying source expressions to the target string
    - fixed a bug where a recursive class inheritance tree would cause a crash
    - fixed a bug where a static class method could not access private members of the class
