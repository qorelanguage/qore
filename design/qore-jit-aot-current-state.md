# Qore JIT and AOT Current Design

## Status

Qore has one LLVM-backed compilation pipeline shared by JIT and AOT:

```text
Qore AST -> Qore IR -> LLVM IR -> native code
```

Runtime modes:

- `--exec-mode=ast`: AST interpreter and default execution mode.
- `--exec-mode=ir`: eager IR lowering and IR interpreter execution.
- `--exec-mode=jit`: eager IR lowering; the program's own functions are compiled
  to native code on a background thread behind a parse-commit barrier, while
  functions imported from modules promote to native adaptively on first use.
- `--exec-mode=tiered`: explicit adaptive execution, promoting hot functions
  AST -> IR -> JIT.
- `qcc`: ahead-of-time compiler and artifact inspection tool for executables,
  `.qmod`, `.qo`, and `.qoa` artifacts.

This document is the durable index for the current IR/JIT/AOT architecture. It
should describe stable contracts and link to narrower design notes; transient
milestones and unfinished task lists belong under `docs/plans/`.

## JIT Runtime

JIT-compiled functions call C ABI helpers in `JITRuntime.cpp` for operations
that need Qore runtime semantics: calls, object/member access, exceptions,
closures, local writes, lvalue mutation, context handling, and cleanup.

The JIT path must preserve:

- `ExceptionSink` semantics through native exception unwinding.
- Qore reference ownership for every returned value.
- Local and closure variable coherence when runtime helpers can observe or
  mutate variables outside native SSA state.
- Debugger-driven AST override in tiered mode.

Implicit `copy()` calls are constructor operations, not ordinary methods. Both
parser paths that create `SelfFunctionCallNode` mark that identity before IR
lowering, including the bare-function rewrite that calls `parseInitCall()`
directly. The flag survives argument-list cloning and directs execution through
`execCopy()`, preserving the dynamic class, copy hooks, and exception cleanup.
Normal method dispatch cannot invoke a copy variant: its calling convention is
different. `ImplicitCopyDispatch.qtest` exercises polymorphic copies and failing
copy hooks in all four execution modes.

## Tiered Execution

Tiered mode starts functions on AST and promotes by call count:

- AST -> IR after `--jit-ir-threshold` calls.
- IR -> JIT after `--jit-jit-threshold` calls.

Native compilation always runs asynchronously on a background thread; promotion
is non-blocking, so a function keeps executing through the IR interpreter until
its compiled form is ready. Program teardown drains only that Program's own
pending background compiles (matched via `QoreIRFunction::pgm`; a compile with no
owning program is treated as matching any teardown), so destroying one Program
never serializes behind unrelated Programs' compilation.

Process shutdown has two ordered JIT phases. It first permanently stops and drains
the background compiler, making its raw references to Program-owned IR safe before
Program teardown begins. Published native code remains mapped while user-module
delete callbacks, registered shutdown handlers, atexit callbacks, and static
destructors can still execute Qore functions. Normal `qore_cleanup()` releases the
LLVM execution engine only after all module Programs have been destroyed. A direct
`exit()` stops compilation but leaves the immortal engine for the operating system to
reclaim, because callback registration order cannot prove that no later process
callback will invoke a published entry point. This boundary prevents both compiler
work from outliving its source IR and cached native function pointers from outliving
their executable mapping, without adding checks to the runtime dispatch path.

Threads that run LLVM are started through `q_start_llvm_compile_thread()` with an
explicit 8MB stack (`QORE_LLVM_COMPILE_STACK_SIZE`), never with `std::thread`, which
cannot request a stack size and takes the platform default: `RLIMIT_STACK` (8MB) on
glibc but a fixed 128KB on musl.  LLVM's analyses recurse over the IR without a depth
bound -- ScalarEvolution recurses once per chained affine add-recurrence -- so a
default-sized musl thread overflows its stack inside LLVM, with no qore frame beneath
the LLVM frames.  Recursion depth follows the number of chained induction variables
rather than function size, so the native-compilation budget is no substitute.  This
applies to the JIT background compile worker and to the AOT codegen thread pools alike.

Failed lowering or compilation disables promotion for that variant rather than
retrying on every call. Debug attach can force dispatch back to AST so debugger
semantics remain predictable; JIT-compiled native code also emits
statement-boundary debug events (gated on `PO_ALLOW_DEBUGGER` and dormant until a
debugger attaches) so an already-running native frame stays debuggable.

## AOT Compiler

`qcc` is the dedicated AOT compiler. It supports:

- Script executables.
- User modules as `.qmod`.
- Per-file `.qo` object files.
- `.qoa` archives for C/C++ hosts.
- Link mode: `qcc -o binary *.qo`.
- Metadata inspection: `qcc --dump-info`, `--dump-symbols`,
  `--dump-sections`.

AOT metadata uses the QORD binary format. Feature flags protect runtime
compatibility: readers reject artifacts requiring unsupported IR/AOT features.

For the object-file and module artifact contract, see
[`aot-object-files-and-module-artifacts.md`](aot-object-files-and-module-artifacts.md).

For multi-file script/application AOT, see
[`aot-script-context.md`](aot-script-context.md).

### Parallel Backend Codegen (split-after-opt)

`qcc` can parallelize LLVM backend codegen for a single compilation. It optimizes
the whole module once (so cross-function optimization is unaffected), then
`llvm::SplitModule(PreserveLocals=false)` partitions the optimized module into N
balanced pieces along whole-function boundaries, codegens each piece concurrently on
a worker thread (each with its own `LLVMContext` via a bitcode round-trip, since a
`Value*` may not cross contexts, plus its own `TargetMachine`), and `ld -r`
partial-links the per-partition objects back into one relocatable object.
`SplitModule` externalizes internal symbols, so after the merge qcc re-internalizes
the extras (ELF: `objcopy --localize-symbols`) to keep the split object
symbol-equivalent to the single-object build. Output is byte-deterministic wherever
the single-object build is.

- `--jobs=N` selects the number of codegen threads (default: CPU count, capped at
  32; `1` = single-object, the reference path). `qcc` propagates it to the backend
  via the `QCC_JOBS` environment variable.
- Splitting is gated by a size threshold (`QCC_SPLIT_THRESHOLD`, default `50000`
  optimized-IR instructions — a CPU-speed-invariant metric) so trivially small
  modules are never split.
- Concurrency is bounded by a **GNU make jobserver client**: qcc parses `MAKEFLAGS`
  and acquires tokens *before* splitting; if no spare tokens are available (a
  saturated `make -jN`), it falls back to single codegen so a parallel build is
  never oversubscribed. The client supports both the make 4.4+ named-pipe form
  (`--jobserver-auth=fifo:PATH`) and the older inherited-fd form
  (`--jobserver-auth=R,W` / `--jobserver-fds=R,W`); each qcc process owns one
  implicit job slot and uses extra codegen threads only for tokens it can acquire
  non-blockingly. This makes parallel codegen safe to leave default-on under
  `make -j`.
- `QORE_AOT_SIZE_DEBUG` traces the module instruction count and the split decision.

## User Module Build Behavior

`QORE_BUILD_AOT_MODULES` defaults to `ON`. The CMake build compiles user
modules to `.qmod` artifacts with `qcc` and installs those artifacts alongside
the source modules. Module lookup prefers the compiled `.qmod` over the `.qm`
when both are present in the same module location.

This makes the installed default fast while preserving source modules for
documentation, inspection, and development.

## Lowering And Fallback Policy

IR/JIT/AOT lowering must be fail-closed. Unsupported expressions,
instructions, or metadata combinations must produce diagnostics with enough
opcode, node, type, and source-location context to implement native lowering;
they must not silently emit `EXPR_TREE`, `GENERIC_EVAL`, or source fallback.

AOT artifacts require complete serialized metadata. Source text can be embedded
for diagnostics or inspection, but it is not a runtime fallback for missing AOT
metadata.

## IR Analysis And Optimization

Lowered functions carry transient facts for each SSA value: known type,
assigned state, NOTHING exclusion, and runtime representation. Assignment is a
separate fact from the declared type. In particular, a typed lvalue is not
assigned before its first write and becomes NOTHING again after remove/delete;
reference parameters retain reference assignment semantics while value reads
use the declared target type.

`QoreIRAnalysis` provides normalized SSA-operand and normal-successor visitors,
plus reusable reachability, predecessor/successor, dominator, and natural-loop
analysis. Generic operands carry phi inputs and dynamic lvalue-path and slice
values, while the visitor also covers operands stored only in dedicated
instruction fields. The IR interpreter uses it for ownership use counts,
preventing dedicated instruction fields from diverging from generic operand
handling.

LLVM call-argument cleanup must preserve a temporary while its SSA value has
remaining uses. Virtual implicit arguments can share one mapped value across
several calls, as in `map (f($1), g($1)), (map make($1), xs)`. Only the final
use may pass the temporary's cleanup slot to a consuming call helper; earlier
calls borrow it. `AOTSharedMapArgs.qtest` covers this lifetime through calls,
branches, duplicate arguments, and exception unwinding.

The first generic optimization built on this layer is conservative scalar
loop-invariant code motion. It moves only native scalar constants, proven
assigned and non-NOTHING non-reference IR-only local loads, and non-throwing
native scalar operations. A local written in the loop is never hoisted. Loops
must have a unique unconditional preheader, and the preheader must precede the
loop in IR block-list order while the LLVM emitter still resolves ordinary SSA
operands in that order. Every hoisted result must have only repeated,
non-consuming scalar users inside the loop. Loads are not hoisted across calls
or other operations that can invalidate interpreter local slots. These rules
preserve the runtime ownership and assigned-state lifetime represented by each
SSA slot. The post-optimization verifier is mandatory for both runtime and AOT
source lowering. `QORE_DISABLE_IR_LICM=1` disables only LICM, while
`QORE_DISABLE_IR_OPT=1` disables all IR passes; `QORE_IR_OPT_STATS=1` reports
analyzed loops and hoisted instructions.

After LICM, a same-basic-block scalar pass forwards repeated loads of IR-only
locals and eliminates repeated native scalar constants and arithmetic or
comparison expressions. Load forwarding requires the value facts to prove an
assigned, non-NOTHING native `int`, `float`, or `bool`; declared type alone is
not sufficient. Explicit local writes invalidate that local, while references,
calls, lvalue operations, scope exits, and other operations that can mutate an
unknown local invalidate all available loads. Discovery is cancellation-safe
and no definition is erased until all replacements have been selected. A value
is merged only when every consumer is a non-consuming scalar operation or an
IR-only local store; call arguments, runtime-visible stores, phi inputs, and
lvalue paths retain distinct SSA ownership. Set `QORE_DISABLE_IR_CSE=1` to
retain the unoptimized same-binary path; the `QORE_IR_OPT_STATS=1` output
includes forwarded-load and eliminated-expression counts.

The optimizer also replaces a conditional branch whose SSA condition is a
literal boolean with an unconditional branch. It deliberately leaves the
unreachable block and phi structure intact; native backends remove that code,
while the IR interpreter avoids repeated condition dispatch in constant-path
loops. `QORE_DISABLE_IR_CONST_FOLD=1` retains the conditional form for
same-binary comparisons, and optimization statistics report folded branches.

Recognized builtin and pseudo-method operations also carry a stable
`QoreIRIntrinsic` identity. The builder assigns the identity when it creates a
resolved pseudo call, and artifact readers reconstruct it once from serialized
method metadata. Interpreter and LLVM fast-path selection dispatch on this
identity instead of repeatedly comparing class and method names. Runtime name
dispatch remains the fallback for unresolved or unsupported calls and retains
precedence for objects and hash-like values whose members can override pseudo
methods.

The IR interpreter also computes a transitive external-cache effect summary for
resolved direct user-function calls. Local writes to globals, thread-locals,
closures, references, and unknown call forms remain immediately effectful.
Known direct-call edges are solved to a fixed point, so pure recursive call
components are recognized without recursive-analysis guesses. Missing callee
IR, reference arguments, direct methods, and closures remain conservative. The
summary is published atomically after the complete reachable call graph is
known; until then callers invalidate caches as before.
`QORE_DISABLE_IR_EFFECT_SUMMARY=1` keeps the conservative direct-call policy for
same-binary comparisons, and `QORE_IR_EFFECT_SUMMARY_STATS=1` reports each
resolved graph's size and result.

## Validated Registries

The current implementation relies on explicit registries for extension safety:

- Opcode metadata is validated before IR verification.
- IR expression lowering uses explicit claim predicates; a handler that claims
  a node must either return IR or report why native lowering is impossible.
- AOT expression-slot, expression-node, and instruction-group registries are
  validated before serialization; unknown instruction subclasses fail
  serialization with the dynamic C++ type name.
- JIT runtime helpers are listed in one registry in `JITRuntime.cpp`; the JIT
  validates names, addresses, and duplicates before registering ORC symbols.
- Type-spec match dispatch validates complete, duplicate-free coverage of the
  closed built-in `q_typespec_t` set before dispatch.

## Current Hardening Rules

- Runtime-only changes should not force all `.qmod` files to rebuild. The
  `qcc-format` stamp tracks sources that affect emitted qmod format or compile
  semantics.
- Split-directory module qmods must live beside their resource files so
  `get_script_dir()` remains valid during AOT initialization.
- AOT local-slot tables preserve IR local slot IDs for deferred handler
  execution.
- Expression-tree member defaults are materialized after constants are
  registered so class and namespace constants can be referenced safely.
- `.qo` metadata preload creates declaration shells only; it must not execute
  user code during compile-time name/type resolution.
- Batch AOT registration must keep cross-session barriers: shells, type/base
  resolution, constants, members, functions, then final class fixups.
- A constant whose `__const_init` did not populate it at load must be
  recoverable from its first read, and a read that cannot recover must report
  why the initializer failed rather than only that the value is missing. See
  [`aot-constant-init-recovery.md`](aot-constant-init-recovery.md).

## Exception Source Locations

AOT-compiled code reports real per-frame source file and line numbers in
exceptions, matching interpreted execution. The throwing location and full
backtrace are reconstructed lazily at throw from line-number tables embedded in
the artifact (emitted by default with debug info), so non-throwing code carries
no per-statement location-updater cost. `--strip-debug-info` emits no line
tables and retains the per-statement updater instead. Source text is not
required: stripped-source artifacts still report file and line from the line
tables.

For the innermost-frame detection mechanism that decides, at throw, whether the
innermost user frame is AOT (and therefore whether to resolve lazily), see
[`aot-lazy-loc-innermost-frame.md`](aot-lazy-loc-innermost-frame.md).

## Exception Cleanup Dominance

LLVM `invoke` results that own Qore references may be cleaned up directly from
SSA only when the defining block dominates every cleanup use. The general path
therefore keeps the safer cleanup-alloca representation unless dominance is
proven.

Do not relax this rule without a real dominator-tree or equivalent
scope/finalization design. See
[`aot-eh-cleanup-dominance.md`](aot-eh-cleanup-dominance.md).

## Large Function Bodies and Cleanup Scaling

Every per-statement exception and thread-exit check in a function branches to
one shared `error_return` block, and that block releases each IR-only local that
owns its value in its own alloca. Emitting one `load` / `store NOTHING` /
`qore_rt_decref` triple per local there is correct but does not scale: SROA
promotes those slots to SSA, so each local then needs a PHI in `error_return`
for *every* edge reaching it. The PHI count is therefore
`IR-only locals x exit edges`, PHI elimination expands each PHI operand into a
machine `COPY`, and LLVM's register coalescer and allocator go superlinear on
the result. A 150-statement body produced 151 PHIs across 751 predecessors —
113k PHI operands and 235k `COPY`s — and took over ten seconds to code-generate;
at 400 statements it did not finish in two minutes. The same body lowered
without the LLVM optimizer, where the slots stay in memory, code-generated in
0.7 seconds, which is what identifies the cleanup shape rather than the function
size as the cause.

This is the same shape clang avoids in its own EH cleanups: clang keeps cleanup
state addressed through memory (`cleanup.dest.slot`, destructor objects
referenced by their alloca address) and emits each cleanup once, so no
cleanup-referenced value ever becomes a promoted SSA value needing a PHI per
exit. Qore now does the same thing where it matters.

`QoreIRToLLVM::prepareBoxedExitCleanupArray()` measures both factors at function
finalization — the number of boxed exit-cleanup slots and the predecessor count
of `error_return_block` — and, only when their product exceeds
`getCleanupPhiBudget()` (`QORE_JIT_CLEANUP_PHI_BUDGET`, default 4096), records
the slot addresses in an entry-block array and replaces the whole triple
sequence with a single `qore_rt_cleanup_run_allocas()` call. Taking the slot
addresses keeps them in memory, so no PHI is needed and code generation stays
linear. The slot set is everything `emitPreinstantiatedCleanup()` releases, in
emission order: pre-instantiated entry cleanup slots, fast-entry parameter
slots, then the IR-only locals that own their value directly — covering only one
of the three leaves the other two to rebuild the same web. Every function below
the budget — which is every ordinary function — keeps the inline triples and
full SSA promotion of its slots, so the trade-off is confined to bodies where
promotion could not pay off anyway.

`prepareIteratorCleanupArray()` applies the identical treatment to
`iterator_cleanup_allocas` and `qore_rt_iterator_cleanup_allocas()`. Iterator
cleanup is written both in the shared error-return block and, by
`emitLateExitCleanup()`, at every `ret`/`resume`, so its multiplier is the same
edge count.

A third instance of the pattern lives on the temp-boundary path.
`flushLocalReloadStateAtTempBoundary()` emitted a two-block NOTHING test per
tracked local at *every* temp boundary, so a function paid
`tracked locals x temp boundaries` basic blocks: the reflection test's
1621-line `namedCallReflectionTests()` reached 88062 rotations — 95% of its
184933 basic blocks and 74% of its instructions, before the optimizer ran at
all — and could not be code-generated in half an hour. Above
`getReloadChainCallThreshold()` (`QORE_JIT_RELOAD_CHAIN_CALL_THRESHOLD`, default
32 tracked locals) the same test and rotation run inside
`qore_rt_reload_chain_rotate()` / `qore_rt_reload_chain_clear()`, which emits one
call and no extra block. Smaller functions keep the inline form so LLVM can fold
it away.

Together these took that method from an unbounded hang to 29s.

Two details matter for correctness. The runtime helper releases slots in LIFO
order, so the addresses are stored in reverse and the values are released in
exactly the order the inline sequence used; destruction order of locals is
observable through destructors. And the choice is made before any cleanup is
written, so the shared error-return block and the shared EH common-cleanup block
agree on which form they emit.

The IR-side dataflow analyses that feed this path (`qore_ir_mark_local_list_pushes()`
and `qore_ir_mark_in_place_string_appends()`) use `QoreIRLocalBitSet`, a dense
bit vector, as their lattice element. A hash set copies one node per element on
every block merge and transfer, which costs `O(blocks x candidate locals)`
allocations and was the largest remaining cost of lowering a very large body.
