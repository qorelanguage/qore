# Data Provider Development Guide

This guide covers patterns, examples, and common pitfalls for building Qore data provider integrations.

A typical integration consists of:
1. **REST Client Module** (`*RestClient.qm`) - HTTP communication and authentication
2. **Data Provider Module** (`*DataProvider/`) - Data provider API and action catalog

This guide covers **hand-written** actions. When the vendor publishes a maintained OpenAPI 3 description,
actions can instead be generated from it with the `RestSchemaActions` module — see
[data-provider-rest-schema-apps.md](data-provider-rest-schema-apps.md) for how to choose, and for the
layout and schema-pinning conventions that path uses. The REST client module, `registerApp()` and every
event provider are hand-written either way, so most of this guide still applies.

## File Structure

## REST Client Module

### Connection Scheme Registration

Add to `qlib/ConnectionProvider/ConnectionSchemeCache.qc`:

```qore
const SchemeMap = {
    "myservice": "MyServiceRestClient",
};
```

**Critical: every URL constant in the module must use a scheme that is actually registered.** If the module registers `myservice` but the `DefaultConnectionUrl` constant uses `myservices://` (with a typo'd trailing `s`, or any other unregistered variant), the framework parses the URL, sees an unknown scheme, marks the connection as `(InvalidConnection)` with `type: "invalid"`, no `app`, no `has_provider` — and the connection silently disappears from the action picker because invalid connections are filtered out. This is the kind of bug that `qrest connections/<name>` will surface as a `URL-ARG-ERROR: ... references unknown scheme ... known schemes: [...]` alert, but only after a connection actually exists. Always grep your module for every scheme literal (`grep -rn '<schemename>' qlib/<Module>*`) and verify each appears in the schemes list registered via `ConnectionSchemeCache::registerScheme()`.

### Associating a Connection with its App

`AbstractConnection::getAppName()` returns nothing by default, and `getInfo()` reports an `app` key only
when it returns a value, so a connection that does not override it is never associated with its
application:

```qore
*string getAppName() {
    return "MyService";
}
```

### OAuth2: Declare It, Do Not Configure It

The consuming platform performs OAuth2 through its API servers, which hold the client ID and secret for
every supported app, so that **the OAuth2 secret is never exposed to an instance**. What the module supplies is
everything else about the flow; what it must not supply is the credentials:

```qore
const ConnectionScheme = <ConnectionSchemeInfo>{
    ...
    # this is what declares that the connection supports OAuth2
    "required_options": "api_key|token|oauth2_auth_url,oauth2_grant_type,oauth2_token_url,"
        "oauth2_client_id,oauth2_client_secret",
    "options": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options + {
        "oauth2_auth_url": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options.oauth2_auth_url
        + <ConnectionOptionInfo>{"default_value": DefaultAuthUrl},
        "oauth2_grant_type": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options.oauth2_grant_type
        + <ConnectionOptionInfo>{"default_value": DefaultGrantType},
        "oauth2_token_url": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options.oauth2_token_url
        + <ConnectionOptionInfo>{"default_value": DefaultTokenUrl},
        "oauth2_scopes": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options.oauth2_scopes
        + <ConnectionOptionInfo>{"default_value": DefaultOAuth2Scopes},
    },
};
```

`required_options` is the declaration: names separated by commas are required together, alternatives
are separated by `|`. Listing the OAuth2 set as one alternative is what declares that this connection can
be authorized through the API servers; the client ID and secret then arrive from
`dataprovider/apps/<App>/oauth2_clients` and never live in the module or the connection.

Check what the API servers already publish for the app before writing any of this:

```bash
qrest dataprovider/apps/Stripe/oauth2_clients
```

**Getting this wrong fails silently.** The connection is created, the ping runs, and the only symptom
is an HTTP 401, because no token was ever obtained:

```
REST-PING-ERROR: HTTP 401 from RestClientIo ping GET "/v1/balance"
```

Three mistakes produce exactly that:

- **No default `oauth2_grant_type`.** Without a grant type the flow never runs at all, so the
  connection sits there with no token. Default it; do not leave it to the user.
- **The wrong authorization or token URL.** Services often run more than one OAuth2 flow — Stripe
  serves its legacy Connect flow from `connect.stripe.com` and current Stripe Apps from
  `marketplace.stripe.com` with a `/v2` authorize endpoint and a token endpoint on the main API host.
  Take the URLs from a connection that is known to work rather than from the first page of the docs.
- **No `required_options` entry naming the OAuth2 options.** The flow is then never offered.

**A module that also supports a plain API key must not force the OAuth2 options onto that path.**
Setting a grant type makes the client demand the whole OAuth2 option set:

```
OAUTH2-ERROR: OAuth2 grant type "authorization_code" requires option "oauth2_client_id", ...
```

Remove them when a key was supplied, **after** applying defaults — otherwise the default puts the grant
type straight back:

```qore
map opts{$1.key} = $1.value, DefaultOptions.pairIterator(), !opts.hasKey($1.key);
if (key_auth) {
    opts -= OAuth2Options;
}
```

The test is whether a **key** was supplied, not whether a token is set. An authorized OAuth2 connection
also has a token — the access token the flow returned — and it still needs its OAuth2 options, or the
token can never be refreshed when it expires.

A service-account flow is not this. Google Cloud Storage mints its own bearer token from a service
account key and takes no interactive authorization, so it declares neither OAuth2 defaults nor an
OAuth2 alternative in `required_options` — correctly.

### Connection Options

Use `apikey` instead of `token` (inherited `token` has special handling that causes issues):

```qore
"options": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options + {
    "apikey": <ConnectionOptionInfo>{
        "display_name": "API Key",
        "type": "string",
        "sensitive": True,
        "preselected": True,
    },
    "domain": <ConnectionOptionInfo>{
        "display_name": "Domain",
        "type": "string",
        "default_value": ".com",
        "allowed_values": (
            <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": ".com", "display_name": "US"},
            <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": ".eu", "display_name": "EU"},
        ),
    },
},
```

### Required Connection Options

Mark connection options as required via `required_options` in the `ConnectionScheme` (NOT `required: True` in individual options - that field doesn't exist in `ConnectionOptionInfo`):

```qore
const ConnectionScheme = <ConnectionSchemeInfo>{
    "options": RestConnection::ConnectionScheme.options + {
        "account_id": <ConnectionOptionInfo>{...},
        "apikey": <ConnectionOptionInfo>{...},
    },
    "required_options": "account_id,apikey",  // Comma-separated string
};
```

### Auto-URL Connections

For `auto_url: True`, implement `getConfig()`:

```qore
private static hash<auto> getConfig(hash<auto> config) {
    string domain = config.opts.domain ?? ".com";
    return config + {"url": sprintf("myscheme://api.service%s/v1", domain)};
}
```

**`auto_url: True` without source options is a footgun.** When `auto_url: True` is declared but the connection has no domain/region/host option for the framework to build the URL from (and `getConfig()` doesn't override it), the framework silently substitutes `<scheme>://localhost` as the URL. Every connection then attempts to talk to `localhost:443` and fails with `SOCKET-CONNECT-ERROR: Connection refused`.

**For fixed-endpoint APIs** (a single global URL like `https://api.service.com/v1` with no per-tenant domain), either:

- Hard-code the URL in `getConfig()` so the framework's auto-fallback can never run:

  ```qore
  private static hash<auto> getConfig(hash<auto> config) {
      # Single fixed endpoint — always use the canonical URL regardless of what
      # the framework's auto_url machinery passes in (which would otherwise
      # default to "<scheme>://localhost" because there is no domain option).
      return config + {"url": MyServiceRestClientBase::DefaultConnectionUrl};
  }
  ```

- Also override `setUpdateOptionsCode()` so any subsequent options update re-corrects the URL (mirrors the existing OAuth2 URL-rebuild pattern):

  ```qore
  setUpdateOptionsCode(*code update_options) {
      UpdateOptionsInterface::setUpdateOptionsCode(update_options);
      if (update_options) {
          hash<auto> update;
          if (url != MyServiceRestClientBase::DefaultConnectionUrl) {
              update.url = MyServiceRestClientBase::DefaultConnectionUrl;
          }
          if (opts.ping_path =~ /^\//) {
              update.ping_path = opts.ping_path.substr(1);
          }
          if (update) {
              doUpdateOptions(self, update);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

The `DefaultConnectionUrl` scheme **must** match the registered scheme (see [Connection Scheme Registration](#connection-scheme-registration)).

### OAuth2 Configuration

**Critical for refresh tokens:**

```qore
public {
    const DefaultAuthArgs = {
        "access_type": "offline",
        "prompt": "consent",
    };
}
```

**In getConnectionOptions() - always rebuild URLs from domain:**

```qore
*hash<auto> getConnectionOptions(*hash<auto> rtopts) {
    hash<auto> rv = RestConnection::getConnectionOptions(rtopts);

    string domain = rv.domain ?? ".com";
    rv.oauth2_auth_url = sprintf("https://accounts.service%s/oauth/v2/auth", domain);
    rv.oauth2_token_url = sprintf("https://accounts.service%s/oauth/v2/token", domain);

    if (!rv.oauth2_auth_args) {
        rv.oauth2_auth_args = DefaultAuthArgs;
    }
    return rv;
}
```

### Ping Path Rules

- **With base path in URL** (e.g., `/books/v3`): Use relative path `organizations` (no leading slash)
- **Without base path**: Use absolute path `/v3/organizations`

Leading slash = absolute path that bypasses base URL path.

## Data Provider Module

### Factory Registration

Add to `qlib/DataProvider/DataProvider.qc`:

```qore
const FactoryMap = {
    "myservice": "MyServiceDataProvider",
};
```

**Without this entry:** Module loads fine but doesn't appear in the apps list.

### App Registration

```qore
DataProviderActionCatalog::registerApp(<DataProviderAppInfo>{
    "name": AppName,
    "display_name": "My Service",
    "short_desc": "Integration with My Service",
    "desc": "Provides integration with [My Service](https://myservice.com) for managing "
        "resources, contacts, and billing.\n\n"
        "Supported operations:\n"
        "- **Resources**: create, update, delete, and list\n"
        "- **Contacts**: create, search, and manage\n"
        "- **Billing**: invoice creation and payment tracking",
    "scheme": "myservice",
    "logo": MyServiceLogo,
    "logo_file_name": "myservice-logo.svg",
    "logo_mime_type": MimeTypeSvg,
    "groups": (AppGroup::Finance,),  // Use enum, not strings!
});
```

### Making the App Visible: the Provider Index

Registering the factory and the app is not enough for the app to appear in tooling. Data provider
metadata is served from a **provider index**, and an app that is not in the index does not exist as
far as anything reading it is concerned:

```bash
qdp @MyService
# qdp: ERROR: Application "MyService" is unknown; known applications: ["Qore", "Db", ...]
```

`QORE_PROVIDER_INDEX_DIR` decides which path is taken:

- **set** (the normal deployed configuration): tools read the index and do **not** scan modules. A newly
  installed app is invisible until the index is rebuilt.
- **unset**: tools call `DataProvider::registerKnownFactories()`, which loads every module named in
  `DataProvider::FactoryMap`, so a correctly registered app is found immediately.

That difference is why an app can work perfectly when loaded directly and still be missing from the
catalogue. Confirm which case you are in before concluding that registration is broken:

```qore
# loads the module explicitly - proves registration, not visibility
load_module("MyServiceDataProvider");
printf("%y\n", DataProviderActionCatalog::getApp("MyService").display_name);
```

**Rebuild the index after installing**, in this order — each step feeds the next:

```bash
sudo make install                 # in the qore repo: modules into the system qlib
copy-qore-modules                 # into the deployed qlib; qmods are no longer live from the build tree
qctl update-index                 # rebuild the index
# restart the platform to pick up the new modules
```

Running `qctl update-index` before the modules are in place fails qualification when the expected
inventory names the app. The ordering still matters: install first so the discovery source and its
owner path are available to the qualified generation.

To verify, either ask for the app directly, or look for its index chunk, which is named for the
SHA-256 of the **app name**:

```bash
qdp @MyService
ls "${QORE_PROVIDER_INDEX_DIR}/qore-data-index-$(printf 'MyService' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1).msgpack"
```

**Two conditions make an app ineligible for a qualified index**. Both are structured discovery
failures and prevent atomic publication; logs are diagnostic and are not the success contract:

- `Data provider app "X" has no module path` — the app registered without a resolvable module,
  usually because it was registered from a script rather than from a module on the module path.
- `Data provider app "X" has unregistered scheme "y"` — `app.scheme` names a scheme missing from
  `SchemeMap`, so registering the app but forgetting the scheme drops the app from the index
  entirely, not just its connections.

Provider initialization has the same rule. Eager and deferred registration failures retain their
technical app/action identity across retries. Source loaders, factories, and index publication report
their own structured phase. Only a sealed generation with all expected identities may replace an
index, and a catalog mutation after sealing invalidates its single-use token. See
[data-provider-discovery-qualification.md](data-provider-discovery-qualification.md).

### Nested presentation metadata

An option's `display_name`, `short_desc`, and `desc` are not the end of its presentation surface.
Fields reachable through its structured type, list elements, union alternatives, and their finite
values are also user-visible. The catalog generator walks this graph with cycle detection. First-layer
fields retain action/option context; deeper reusable structures use stable app/action/option/occurrence/type/field
identities. The occurrence includes the canonical technical field path and any union context above it, and the type
segment includes an explicit producer schema path when available plus a digest of immediate technical field/type
shape. One canonical occurrence is assigned per concrete type object in each action/option. This distinguishes
anonymous schemas without making IDs depend on labels and avoids expanding a shared schema DAG once per path.
Regenerate every root and complete locale after changing either a field label or the type graph that makes it
reachable. The runtime fallback is not evidence that a shipped locale is complete.

### Description Formatting

- **`short_desc`**: Plain text, under 80 characters, single sentence — no markdown
- **`desc`**: Markdown-formatted text rendered in the UI. Use:
  - Backticks for code/field references: `` `field_name` ``, `` `True` ``, `` `False` ``, `` `NOTHING` ``
  - Backticks for numeric values with semantic meaning: `` `0` ``–`` `255` ``, `` `-100` ``–`` `100` ``
  - Backticks for URL schemes: `` `http://` ``, `` `mcp://` ``
  - Backticks for format/type values: `` `xlsx` ``, `` `csv` ``, `` `json` ``
  - **Bold** for emphasis on important caveats: `**Note**:`, `**Important**:`
  - Bullet lists for enumerating options or capabilities
  - `[links](url)` for documentation references
  - `\n\n` for paragraph breaks in multi-paragraph descriptions
  - Capital letter at the start of every sentence

Short descriptions (1-2 simple sentences) don't need markdown — focus formatting effort on longer, complex descriptions.

#### Long Descriptions (>500 chars)

Descriptions for complex options (draw commands, field format specifications, multi-feature configurations) should be structured with bold section headers and bullet lists:

```qore
"desc": "A hash describing the CSV fields. Keys are field names. Values are "
    "[field types](url) or a hash with the following keys:\n"
    "- `type`: a [field type string](url)\n"
    "- `format`: for `date` types, a [date format](url); for `int`, `float`, or "
        "`number` types, a number format string\n"
    "- `timezone`: for `date` types only; overrides any default time zone\n\n"
    "**Note**: setting this value also sets `headers` if not set automatically.",
```

For very long descriptions with many items (e.g., 20+ draw commands), group related items under bold section headers:

```qore
"desc": "List of draw command hashes. Each command has an `op` key.\n\n"
    "**Color and Style**:\n"
    "- `set_source_rgb` (r, g, b) — color values 0.0–1.0\n"
    "- `set_source_rgba` (r, g, b, a)\n\n"
    "**Paths**:\n"
    "- `move_to` (x, y)\n"
    "- `line_to` (x, y)\n\n"
    "**Drawing**:\n"
    "- `stroke` — draw the current path outline\n"
    "- `fill` — fill the current path",
```

#### Common Description Mistakes

| Mistake | Wrong | Correct |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Bare boolean | `If True then...` | `` If `True` then... `` |
| Bare nothing | `returns nothing` | `` returns `NOTHING` `` |
| Single quotes for code | `'xlsx' format` | `` `xlsx` format `` |
| Lowercase sentence start | `if true then...` | `If true then...` |
| Missing opening backtick | `` field_name` `` | `` `field_name` `` |
| Bare field reference | `see ssl_key_path` | `` see `ssl_key_path` `` |

#### Data Examples in Descriptions

When a field accepts structured data (JSON objects/arrays, CSV, delimited strings, regex patterns, or other format-specific syntax), the `desc` field **must** include:

1. A summary sentence describing what the field expects
2. A structured property list (for JSON objects) or format specification (for delimited strings)
3. A concrete `**Example**:` with backtick-wrapped sample data

```qore
# Poor: generic description
"desc": "JSON array of text annotation objects to add",

# Good: structured with properties and example
"desc": "JSON array of text annotation objects to add to the PDF.\n\n"
    "**Annotation object properties**:\n"
    "- `text` (required) — text to add\n"
    "- `x`, `y` (required) — position coordinates in points\n"
    "- `size` — font size (default: `12`)\n"
    "- `fontName` — font name (default: `Arial`)\n\n"
    "**Example**: `[{\"x\": 100, \"y\": 200, \"text\": \"Hello\", \"size\": 14}]`",
```

Fields that need data examples:
- JSON object/array fields — document properties and provide a sample object
- CSV/delimited format fields — document delimiter, column structure, and provide a sample
- Regex/pattern fields — describe syntax and provide an example pattern
- Fields with non-obvious format requirements (page ranges, coordinate systems, hex colors)

#### List Types vs Delimited Strings

When a field logically accepts multiple values of the same type (e.g., multiple URLs, IDs, tags), use a **list type** rather than a delimited string:

```qore
# Poor: comma-delimited string
"url": {
    "type": StringOrNothingType,
    "desc": "Comma-separated URLs to process",
},

# Good: proper list type with join in doRequestImpl()
"url": {
    "type": SoftListOrNothingType,
    "desc": "Source URLs to process",
},

# In doRequestImpl():
if (req.url.typeCode() == NT_LIST) {
    req.url = (foldl $1 + "," + $2, req.url);
}
```

**Why**: List types render as proper list inputs in the UI (add/remove items). Delimited strings require users to manually concatenate values.

**When to keep strings**: When the delimiter format includes structured sub-fields (e.g., `page;fieldName;value`) or range syntax (e.g., `0, 2-5, 7-`), keep as `StringOrNothingType` since list semantics don't apply.

### Base Class Pattern

```qore
public class MyDataProviderBase inherits AbstractDataProvider {
    private { MyRestClient rest; }

    constructor(MyRestClient rest) { self.rest = rest; }

    constructor(*hash<auto> options) {
        *hash<auto> copts = checkOptions("CONSTRUCTOR-ERROR", ConstructorOptions, options);
        rest = copts.myrestclient ?? new MyRestClient({"apikey": copts.apikey});
    }
}
```

### Reference Data (Dropdowns)

For `ref_data` in action options:

```qore
*hash<string, bool> getSupportedReferenceData() {
    return {"customers": True, "items": True};
}

private *list<hash<AllowedValueInfo>> getReferenceDataImpl(string type, *hash<auto> opts) {
    if (type == "customers") {
        return map <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": $1.id, "display_name": $1.name},
               doGet("/customers").content;
    }
}
```

**Both names and signatures must match the abstract base exactly.** Qore's method dispatch matches overrides by name AND parameter list. A mismatch silently falls through to the no-op base implementation — there is no "method not overridden" warning at module load, no exception at runtime, no log message. The dropdown just stays empty and you spend hours grepping for `getOrderStatusList` HTTP calls that never happen.

The two failure modes:

1. **Wrong method name (`Impl` suffix on the wrong method)**

   `getSupportedReferenceData()` has **no `Impl` suffix** in `AbstractDataProvider`. Overriding `getSupportedReferenceDataImpl()` (with `Impl`) does nothing — the framework calls the un-suffixed method, which returns the empty default. Every `ref_data` lookup then fails with `UNSUPPORTED-REFERENCE-DATA` on the strict path or quietly returns nothing on the lenient path.

2. **Wrong signature (extra parameters on `getReferenceDataImpl`)**

   The canonical signature is exactly `(string type, *hash<auto> action_opts)` — two parameters. Any divergence (e.g., a 3-arg `(string kind, *string filter_value, *hash<auto> depends_on_values)`) doesn't match what the framework calls, so the override is never invoked. No API request, no warning, empty dropdown.

Both bugs are invisible to the type system because the override is a separate method declaration, not an abstract method implementation that fails at parse time. The only safe practice is to copy the canonical signature verbatim from `qlib/DataProvider/AbstractDataProvider.qc`.

### Cascading ref_data (Dependent Dropdowns)

When a ref_data dropdown depends on the value of another field (e.g., listing applied tags for a
specific contact, or listing cycles for a selected team), use the `has_dependents`/`depends_on`/
`on_change` pattern. The UI selects the controlling field first, triggers a refetch, and
`getReferenceDataImpl()` uses the `action_opts` parameter to filter the dependent dropdown.

This is distinct from **Dynamic Options** (§ below), which changes the set of fields entirely.
Cascading ref_data only filters dropdown values — the fields themselves always exist.

**Step 1 — Mark the controlling field** with `has_dependents` and `on_change`:
```qore
"team_id": {
    "type": StringType,
    "display_name": "Team",
    "required": True,
    "ref_data": "teams",
    "has_dependents": True,           # signals UI that other fields depend on this
    "on_change": ("refetch",),        # triggers re-fetch of dependent ref_data on change
},
```

**Step 2 — Mark dependent fields** with `depends_on` and their own `ref_data`:
```qore
"cycle_id": {
    "type": StringOrNothingType,
    "display_name": "Cycle",
    "depends_on": ("team_id",),       # field disabled until team_id is set
    "ref_data": "cycles",             # fetched with action_opts.team_id available
},
```

**Step 3 — Use `action_opts` in `getReferenceDataImpl()`** to pass the controlling value:
```qore
private *list<hash<AllowedValueInfo>> getReferenceDataImpl(string type,
        *hash<auto> action_opts) {
    switch (type) {
        case "teams": return getReferenceTeams();
        case "cycles": return getReferenceCycles(action_opts.team_id);
        case "labels": return getReferenceLabels(action_opts.team_id);
    }
}

private *list<hash<AllowedValueInfo>> getReferenceCycles(*string team_id) {
    if (!team_id) {
        return;  # no team selected yet — dropdown stays empty
    }
    list<auto> cycles = doGet("/teams/" + team_id + "/cycles");
    return map <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": string($1.id), "display_name": $1.name}, cycles;
}
```

**Action registration — use inline `<ActionOptionInfo>`**, not `getActionOptionFromFields()`,
because `getActionOptionFromFields()` does **not** propagate `has_dependents`:

```qore
"options": {
    "team_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{
        "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
        "required": True,
        "ref_data": "teams",
        "has_dependents": True,
        "on_change": ("refetch",),
    },
    "cycle_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{
        "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."*string",
        "depends_on": ("team_id",),
        "ref_data": "cycles",
    },
},
```

**Chaining dependencies**: Dependencies can cascade multiple levels (A → B → C):
```qore
"workspace_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{..., "has_dependents": True, "on_change": ("refetch",)},
"contact_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{..., "depends_on": ("workspace_id",), "has_dependents": True, "on_change": ("refetch",)},
"applied_tag_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{..., "depends_on": ("contact_id",), "ref_data": "applied_tags"},
```

**Conditional dependencies**: Use `"depends_on": ("field=value",)` to only enable a field when
the controlling field has a specific value (e.g., `"depends_on": ("driver=jdbc",)` to show JDBC
classpath only when the JDBC driver is selected).

### Request Type Fields Pattern

Request type classes should declare a `const Fields` hash in a `public {}` block. This allows action registration code to reference fields directly via `ClassName::Fields` without instantiating the type. The same constant is used in the constructor to add fields to the type.

**Important:** Type classes **must** be declared inside the `public namespace` block in the `.qc` file for `ClassName::Fields` to be resolvable from the `.qm` file. Classes declared outside the namespace block cannot have their constants referenced via `ClassName::ConstantName` from other module files.

```qore
public namespace MyServiceDataProvider {
    # Type classes MUST be inside the namespace block

    public class MyCreateRequestDataType inherits HashDataType {
        public {
            const Fields = {
                "name": {
                    "type": StringType,
                    "display_name": "Name",
                    "short_desc": "Resource name",
                    "desc": "Name of the resource to create",
                    "example_value": "My Resource",
                },
                "type": {
                    "type": StringType,
                    "display_name": "Type",
                    "short_desc": "Resource type",
                    "desc": "Type of resource",
                    "allowed_values": (
                        <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": "standard", "display_name": "Standard"},
                        <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": "premium", "display_name": "Premium"},
                    ),
                },
                "description": {
                    "type": StringOrNothingType,
                    "display_name": "Description",
                    "short_desc": "Resource description",
                    "desc": "Optional description of the resource",
                },
            };
        }

        constructor() {
            addQoreFields(Fields);
        }
    }
}  # end namespace
```

Data provider classes should declare `ResponseType` and `RequestType` as static members:

```qore
public class MyCreateDataProvider inherits MyDataProviderBase {
    public {
        static MyCreateRequestDataType RequestType();
        static MyResponseDataType ResponseType();
    }
    # ...
}
```

These are referenced in action registration as `MyCreateDataProvider::ResponseType`.

### HashDataType Constructor Pattern

Type classes that inherit from `HashDataType` MUST register their fields via `addQoreFields(Fields)` from inside the constructor body, NOT by passing `Fields` as a positional argument to the parent constructor.

**Wrong** — silently drops every field:

```qore
public class MyCreateRequestDataType inherits HashDataType {
    public {
        const Fields = { ... };
    }
    constructor() : HashDataType("MyCreateRequestDataType", Fields) {}  # BUG
}
```

**Why this is wrong:** the matching `HashDataType` constructor overload is `(string name = AutoHashType.getName(), *hash<auto> options, *hash<auto> tags, ...)`. When the call passes `Fields` as the second argument, Qore's overload resolution sees a `hash<auto>` and binds it to the `*hash<auto> options` parameter — `Fields` is silently absorbed as connection options. The dedicated fields-aware overload `(string name, hash<string, AbstractDataField> fields, ...)` only matches when the second arg is `hash<string, AbstractDataField>` — a typed hash of `AbstractDataField` instances, not the plain `{ "field": { ... } }` literal that `Fields` actually contains.

The damage: the type ends up with the right name but **zero registered fields**. Wire-level data still flows (the request body is just a JSON hash) so the bug doesn't show up in tests, but every UI that introspects the type schema sees a generic empty hash. Lists of these types render with `element_type: "hash"` instead of the structured form. `getActionOptionFromFields(MyType::Fields)` happens to work because it reads from the const directly, not from the type instance — masking the problem further.

**Correct** — both styles work:

```qore
public class MyCreateRequestDataType inherits HashDataType {
    public {
        const Fields = { ... };
    }
    constructor() : HashDataType("MyCreateRequestDataType") {
        addQoreFields(Fields);
    }
}
```

```qore
public class MyCreateRequestDataType inherits HashDataType {
    public {
        const Fields = { ... };
    }
    constructor() {
        addQoreFields(Fields);
    }
}
```

`addQoreFields(hash<auto> new_fields)` ([qlib/DataProvider/HashDataType.qc:356](../qlib/DataProvider/HashDataType.qc)) iterates the hash and constructs `QoreDataField` instances from each entry — the proper field-registration path. Apply this same pattern to every `HashDataType` subclass in the module: request types, response types, shared sub-types.

### Timestamp Field Types

Date/time fields require special handling because the type that the API consumes on the wire is rarely the type that the UI should expose to a no-code user.

**Rule:** the request type field should be `DateType` (or `DateOrNothingType`) regardless of the API's wire format. The UI then renders a date/time picker. If the API requires another representation (Unix epoch seconds/milliseconds, an ISO 8601 string in a specific format, etc.) the data provider converts the value inside `doRequestImpl()` immediately before serializing the request.

| API wire format | Request type field | Conversion in `doRequestImpl()` |
|---|---|---|
| ISO 8601 string (any flavor) | `DateType` / `DateOrNothingType` | `format_date("YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SSZ", req.field)` (or whichever format the API documents) |
| Unix seconds (integer) | `DateType` / `DateOrNothingType` | `int(get_epoch_seconds(req.field))` |
| Unix milliseconds (integer) | `DateType` / `DateOrNothingType` | `(get_epoch_seconds(req.field) * 1000) + (req.field.microseconds() / 1000)` |
| Local-date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | `DateType` / `DateOrNothingType` | `format_date("YYYY-MM-DD", req.field)` |

**Anti-pattern (do not do this):**

```qore
const Fields = {
    "date_add": {
        "type": SoftIntType,        # API wants Unix seconds, but UI now gets a number input
        "display_name": "Date Added",
        "example_value": 1745280000, # nobody wants to type this
    },
};
```

This is wrong even though the type "matches" the API: the user sees a plain number input and has to know what a Unix timestamp is. The check that the field type matches the API literally is *not* the bar — the bar is what the UI renders.

**Correct pattern:**

```qore
const Fields = {
    "date_add": {
        "type": DateType,
        "display_name": "Date Added",
        "short_desc": "Order creation timestamp",
        "desc": "When the order was created. Sent to the API as Unix seconds.",
        "required": True,
    },
};

# In the corresponding *DataProvider.qc:
private auto doRequestImpl(auto req, *hash<auto> request_options) {
    hash<auto> body = req;
    if (exists req.date_add) {
        body.date_add = int(get_epoch_seconds(req.date_add));
    }
    return base.callMethod("addOrder", body);
}
```

The same rule applies to event/output types: surface dates as `DateType` in the response schema and convert from the API's wire format when building the example/output hash, so downstream FSM steps get a real `date` value to pass into other actions.

## Action Registration

### Action Path Resolution (CRITICAL)

Every `registerAction()` call has a `path` field. **The framework resolves that path against the root data provider's child tree to acquire the data provider that backs the action.** If the path doesn't resolve, the action's data provider is `null`, which silently disables:

- **`ref_data` lookups** — the framework needs the resolved provider to call `getReferenceData()`. No provider → `addExtraOptions opt "X" allowed_values: null` → empty dropdown.
- **`doRequestImpl()` / `searchRecordsImpl()`** — the action can't actually run.
- **Output type schema retrieval** — `output_type` is read from the provider.

The failure mode is silent: the action still appears in the catalog, the option form still renders, but every `ref_data` dropdown is empty and the action throws `INVALID-CHILD-PROVIDER` only when the user actually clicks "execute".

**Two valid layouts**, choose one consistently per provider:

#### Layout A — Flat ChildMap (Aftership convention, recommended for most)

Root provider's `ChildMap` exposes every action provider as a direct child:

```qore
const ChildMap = {
    # Resource/grouping providers
    "trackings": Class::forName("MyService::TrackingsDataProvider"),
    "returns": Class::forName("MyService::ReturnsDataProvider"),

    # Action providers — every DPAT_API action has an entry here
    "create-tracking": Class::forName("MyService::CreateTrackingDataProvider"),
    "delete-tracking": Class::forName("MyService::DeleteTrackingDataProvider"),
    "create-return": Class::forName("MyService::CreateReturnDataProvider"),
    # ...
};
```

Action paths are flat: `path: "/create-tracking"`. Resolves to the `create-tracking` child of the root provider.

#### Layout B — Nested paths matching provider hierarchy

Root provider exposes only resource groupings; each grouping's `ChildMap` contains its own action providers. Action paths must include the full nested path:

```qore
# Root ChildMap
const ChildMap = {
    "trackings": Class::forName("MyService::TrackingsDataProvider"),
};

# In TrackingsDataProvider, its own ChildMap
const ChildMap = {
    "create": Class::forName("MyService::CreateTrackingDataProvider"),
};
```

Action path: `path: "/trackings/create"` (full nested path).

#### What you must NOT do

The bug to avoid is mixing the two: registering an action with a flat path (`/create-tracking`) while only nesting its provider under a grouping (`trackings/create-tracking`). The flat path doesn't resolve, the action is silently broken. Verify by listing root's children and checking that every action's `path.split("/")` first segment is in that list:

```bash
grep -A2 'const ChildMap' qlib/<Module>/<Module>DataProvider.qc
grep -nE '"path":' qlib/<Module>/<Module>DataProvider.qm
```

Reference implementation: [qlib/AftershipDataProvider/AftershipDataProvider.qc](../qlib/AftershipDataProvider/AftershipDataProvider.qc) (flat ChildMap with both grouping and action providers).

### DPAT_FIND - Critical Rule

**Every action option MUST exist in the data provider's `SearchOptions`.**

Framework passes action options to `searchRecordsImpl()` via `search_options`. Missing options cause:
```
SEARCH-OPTION-ERROR: invalid options: ["organization_id"]; supported options: [...]
```

**Pattern:**

```qore
// Action registration
"options": {
    "organization_id": <ActionOptionInfo>{...},
    "status": <ActionOptionInfo>{...},
},

// Data provider - MUST match
const SearchOptions = {
    "organization_id": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{...},
    "status": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{...},
};

const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
    "search_options": SearchOptions,  // Required!
};
```

### DPAT_FIND_SINGLE

Point to **collection provider**, add ID as search option:

```qore
// Action
"path": "/items",  // Collection, not /items/get
"action_code": DPAT_FIND_SINGLE,
"options": {
    "itemID": <ActionOptionInfo>{"required": True, "ref_data": "items"},
},

// Data provider SearchOptions
"itemID": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{...},

// In searchRecordsImpl
if (search_options.itemID) {
    return single item by ID;
}
```

### DPAT_API

Standard request/response pattern. **Every DPAT_API action MUST have `options` and `output_type`** — without them the action appears in the catalog but is completely unusable (no form fields shown to users, no output schema).

Use `DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields()` to generate action options from request type fields. This ensures action options stay in sync with the request type and inherit field metadata (descriptions, types, allowed values, example values).

**Preferred pattern — use class `Fields` constants:**

Request type classes should declare a `const Fields` in a `public {}` block (see [Request Type Fields Pattern](#request-type-fields-pattern) below). Reference fields via `ClassName::Fields` in action registration, and use `DataProviderClassName::ResponseType` for output_type:

```qore
DataProviderActionCatalog::registerAction(<DataProviderActionInfo>{
    "app": AppName,
    "path": "/resource/create",
    "action": "resource-create",
    "display_name": "Create Resource",
    "short_desc": "Create a new resource",
    "desc": "Create a new resource with the given parameters",
    "action_code": DPAT_API,
    "options": DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields(
        MyCreateRequestDataType::Fields{"name", "type", "value"}, {
            "preselected": True,
            "required": True,
        },
    ) + DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields(
        MyCreateRequestDataType::Fields - ("name", "type", "value"),
    ),
    "output_type": MyCreateDataProvider::ResponseType,
});
```

**Hash slice note:** `ClassName::Fields{"key1", "key2"}` (multiple keys) returns a hash slice. For a single key, use `ClassName::Fields{"key",}` (trailing comma) to force list context — without it, `ClassName::Fields{"key"}` returns a single value, not a hash.

**Alternative pattern — instantiate the type:**

If the request type class doesn't have a `Fields` constant, instantiate the type and use `getFields()`:

```qore
MyCreateRequestDataType CreateRequestType();

"options": DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields(
    CreateRequestType.getFields(){"name", "type", "value"}, {
        "preselected": True,
        "required": True,
    },
) + DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields(
    CreateRequestType.getFields() - ("name", "type", "value"),
),
"output_type": AbstractDataProviderType::get(
    new Type("hash<MyCreateResponse>")),
```

**Pattern — all fields optional (no required/preselected split):**

```qore
"options": DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields(
    MyGetInfoRequestDataType::Fields,
),
```

For dynamic options, implement `getRequestTypeWithDataImpl()`.

### DPAT_EVENT

```qore
"action_code": DPAT_EVENT,
"action_val": "item-created",  // Must match getEventTypesImpl() key
```

---

## Event Providers

### Key Pattern: Options from Context

Event providers are created via path navigation **without constructor options**. Get values from context in `observersReady()`.

```qore
public class MyEventProvider inherits MyDataProviderBase, DelayedObservable {
    public {
        const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
            "supports_observable": True,
        };

        // Options MUST be optional types
        const LocalOptions = {
            "itemID": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{
                "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."*string",  // *string, not string
            },
        };
    }

    private { *string itemID; }

    observersReady() {
        if (!itemID) {
            *hash<auto> ctx = DataProviderDataContextHelper::getHash();
            itemID = ctx.itemID;
        }
        if (!itemID) {
            throw "ERROR", "itemID required";
        }
        // Start polling/webhooks
    }

    private hash<string, hash<DataProviderMessageInfo>> getEventTypesImpl() {
        return {
            "item-created": <DataProviderMessageInfo>{
                "desc": "Fires when item created",
                "type": AbstractDataProviderType::get(AutoHashType),
            },
        };
    }

    private auto getExampleEventDataImpl(string event_id) {
        try {
            return doGet("/items", {"limit": 1}).items[0];
        } catch () {
            return {"item_id": "123", "name": "Example"};
        }
    }
}
```

### Events Container

```qore
public class MyEventsProvider inherits MyDataProviderBase {
    public {
        const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
            "supports_children": True,
            "children_can_support_observers": True,
        };
    }

    private *list<string> getChildProviderNamesImpl() {
        return ("item-created", "item-updated");
    }

    private *AbstractDataProvider getChildProviderImpl(string name) {
        return new MyEventProvider(rest);  // No options passed
    }
}
```

### Webhook Enrichment (Minimal Payload)

Some APIs send minimal webhook payloads containing only an object ID or resource URL instead of the full object data. In this case, `handleWebhookEvent()` must make an additional API request to fetch the complete object before notifying observers.

**When to use:** The external API's webhook payload lacks the fields needed by the event data type — typically just an ID, resource URL, or a small subset of fields.

**Pattern:**

```qore
public class MyEventProvider inherits MyDataProviderBase, DelayedObservable {
    private {
        *hash<auto> webhook_info;
        *string webhook_id;
    }

    observersReady() {
        # Create local webhook endpoint
        webhook_info = DataProvider::DataProviderWebhook::createWebhook({
            "method": "POST",
            "callback": \handleWebhookEvent(),
        });

        # Register webhook with external API
        hash<auto> response = doPost("/webhooks", {
            "url": webhook_info.url,
            "event": "item.created",
        });
        webhook_id = response.id;
    }

    private handleWebhookEvent(hash<auto> payload) {
        # payload is minimal, e.g.: {"id": "abc123", "event": "item.created"}

        # Fetch the full object from the API
        hash<auto> full_record;
        try {
            full_record = doGet("/items/" + payload.id);
        } catch (hash<ExceptionInfo> ex) {
            log(LoggerLevel::ERROR, "handleWebhookEvent: error fetching full record: %s",
                get_exception_string(ex));
            return;
        }

        # Notify observers with the enriched data
        notifyObservers(getEventType(), full_record);
    }

    private stopEventsIntern() {
        # Delete webhook from remote API
        if (webhook_id) {
            try {
                doDelete("/webhooks/" + webhook_id);
            } catch (hash<ExceptionInfo> ex) {
                log(LoggerLevel::ERROR, "error deleting webhook: %s", get_exception_string(ex));
            }
            remove webhook_id;
        }

        # Delete local webhook endpoint
        if (webhook_info) {
            DataProvider::DataProviderWebhook::deleteWebhook(webhook_info);
            remove webhook_info;
        }
    }
}
```

**If the payload contains a resource URL** (instead of just an ID), parse it to extract the path:

```qore
private hash<auto> fetchResourceData(string resource_url) {
    hash<auto> url_info = parse_url(resource_url);
    string path = url_info.path ?? "";
    if (url_info.query) {
        path += "?" + url_info.query;
    }
    return doGet(path);
}
```

**Reference implementation:** `ShipStationBaseEventDataProvider.qc` — receives only a `resource_url` in the webhook payload, fetches the full order/shipment via REST, then notifies observers with the enriched data.

---

## Dynamic Options

For fields that depend on a previous selection (e.g., form fields based on selected form).

### Action Registration

```qore
"data_dependent_options": True,
"options": {
    "tableID": <ActionOptionInfo>{
        "structural_determinate": True,
        "on_change": ("refetch",),
        "ref_data": "tables",
    },
},
```

### Data Provider Implementation

Implement **both** methods:

| Method | When Called | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `getRequestTypeWithOptionsImpl()` | UI requests options | Fields shown in UI |
| `getRequestTypeWithDataImpl()` | Request execution | Validates request data |

```qore
private *AbstractDataProviderType getRequestTypeWithOptionsImpl(*hash<auto> options) {
    *string table_id = options.tableID;
    if (!table_id) {
        return RequestType;
    }
    return buildDynamicType(table_id);
}

private *AbstractDataProviderType getRequestTypeWithDataImpl(auto req) {
    if (req.typeCode() != NT_HASH) {
        return RequestType;
    }
    *string table_id = req.tableID;
    if (!table_id) {
        return RequestType;
    }
    return buildDynamicType(table_id);
}
```

Provider implementations should not unwrap UI `{type, value}` hashes.
That encoding belongs to the `context=ui` REST/API boundary; by the time
these methods are called, `options`, request data, and action input should
already be plain Qore values.

---

## Table Data Providers (Record-Based CRUD)

Table data providers expose a collection/table as a record-based interface with support for search
(DPAT_FIND), create, upsert, update, delete, and bulk operations. The key class is
`AbstractDataProvider` with its `*Impl` methods.

### Provider Info Declaration

Declare capabilities in `ProviderInfo`:

```qore
const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
    "desc": "My collection table data provider",
    "type": "MyCollectionTableDataProvider",
    "has_record": True,
    "supports_read": True,
    "supports_native_search": True,
    "supports_create": True,
    "supports_upsert": True,
    "supports_update": True,
    "supports_delete": True,
    "supports_bulk_create": True,
    "supports_bulk_upsert": True,
    "search_options": GenericRecordSearchOptions{"columns", "limit", "offset", "requires_result"} + {
        "query": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{...},
        "filter": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{...},
    },
    "create_options": WriteOptions,
    "upsert_options": WriteOptions,
};
```

### Record Type

Define the record type as a `HashDataType` subclass:

```qore
public class MyScoredPointRecordType inherits DataProvider::HashDataType {
    private {
        const Fields = {
            "id": {"type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."auto", ...},
            "score": {"type": SoftFloatOrNothingType, ...},
            "payload": {"type": AutoHashOrNothingType, ...},
        };
    }

    constructor() {
        addQoreFields(Fields);
    }
}
```

### Key Implementation Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `searchRecordsImpl(*hash<auto> where_cond, *hash<auto> search_options)` | Returns `AbstractDataProviderRecordIterator` |
| `createRecordImpl(hash<auto> rec, *hash<auto> create_options)` | Creates a record, returns it |
| `upsertRecordImpl(hash<auto> rec, *hash<auto> upsert_options)` | Upserts, returns `UpsertResultInserted` or `UpsertResultUpdated` |
| `updateRecordsImpl(hash<auto> set, *hash<auto> where_cond, *hash<auto> search_options)` | Returns count updated |
| `deleteRecordsImpl(*hash<auto> where_cond, *hash<auto> search_options)` | Returns count deleted |
| `getRecordTypeImpl(*hash<auto> search_options)` | Returns `*hash<string, AbstractDataField>` — call `.getFields()` on the data type instance |
| `getStaticInfoImpl()` | Returns `ProviderInfo` |

### Record Iterator Pattern

The iterator wraps backend query results:

```qore
public class MySearchRecordIterator inherits DataProvider::AbstractDataProviderRecordIterator {
    private:internal {
        const RecordType = new MyScoredPointRecordType();
        Qore::ListHashIterator i;
    }

    constructor(RestClient rest, string collection, *hash<auto> where_cond,
            *hash<auto> search_options)
            : AbstractDataProviderRecordIterator(search_options.requires_result) {
        hash<auto> body = buildRequestBody(search_options);
        // ... process where_cond, merge with body ...
        *list<auto> results = rest.post(uri, body).body.result.items;
        i = new ListHashIterator(results);
    }

    bool valid() { return i.valid(); }
    hash<auto> getValue() { return i.getValue(); }
    *hash<string, DataProvider::AbstractDataField> getRecordType() { return RecordType.getFields(); }
    private bool nextImpl() { return i.next(); }
}
```

### Bulk Operations

Implement `getBulkInserter()` and `getBulkUpserter()` returning
`AbstractDataProviderBulkOperation` subclasses. The bulk operation collects records via
`queueData()` and sends them in batches via `flushImpl()`.

### Tables Container Pattern

A parent "tables" provider lists available tables/collections as child providers:

```qore
public class MyTablesDataProvider inherits MyDataProviderBase {
    public {
        const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
            "supports_children": True,
            "children_can_support_records": True,
        };
    }

    private *list<string> getChildProviderNamesImpl() {
        return map $1.name, rest.get("/collections").body.result.collections;
    }

    private *AbstractDataProvider getChildProviderImpl(string name) {
        // Verify collection exists before returning provider
        if (!collectionExists(name)) { return; }
        return new MyCollectionTableDataProvider(rest, name);
    }
}
```

## Server-Side Search Expressions

Search expressions enable the standard DataProvider expression interface (`where_cond` with
expression trees) for backend-specific query languages. This is a critical feature for integrating
with the DPQL query language and UI-driven search builders.

### Architecture

The pattern has three components:

1. **Expression definitions** (`*Defs.qc`): A constant mapping DP operator names to expression
   metadata (`exp`) and implementation closures (`impl`)
2. **Provider info**: Declares supported expressions and `supports_search_expressions: True`
3. **Iterator**: `processExpressionArg()` method that walks the expression tree and calls `impl`
   closures to build the backend-specific query

### How the Framework Processes where_cond

The `AbstractDataProvider` base class has two overloads for each search/update/delete method:

- `*hash<DataProviderExpression> where_cond` — for pre-built expression trees; calls
  `processSearchParameters()` to validate, then passes through to `*Impl()`
- `*hash<auto> where_cond` — for plain hashes; calls `getSearchExpression()` which:
  - If `supports_search_expressions` is True: converts plain hash to expression tree (each
    `key: value` pair becomes a `DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ` expression, multiple pairs wrapped in `DP_OP_AND`)
  - Otherwise: calls `processFieldValues()` for simple field validation

**Important**: When `supports_search_expressions` is True, ALL `*Impl()` methods receive
`DataProviderExpression` where_cond, even for update and delete. Your implementation must handle
this (see "Update/Delete with Expressions" below).

### Expression Definitions File

Create a `*Defs.qc` file with the expression mapping. Each entry has:
- `"exp"`: The expression info from `AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_OP_*}`
- `"impl"`: A closure that builds the backend-specific query structure

**Example** (Qdrant vector database → JSON filters):

```qore
public const MyExpressions = {
    DP_OP_AND: {
        "exp": AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_OP_AND},
        "impl": hash<auto> sub (MyRecordIterator iter, list<auto> args) {
            return {"must": map iter.processExpressionArg($1), args};
        },
    },
    DP_OP_OR: {
        "exp": AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_OP_OR},
        "impl": hash<auto> sub (MyRecordIterator iter, list<auto> args) {
            return {"should": map iter.processExpressionArg($1), args};
        },
    },
    DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ: {
        "exp": AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ},
        "impl": hash<auto> sub (string field, auto value) {
            return {"key": field, "match": {"value": value}};
        },
    },
    // ... other operators ...
};
```

**Example** (Salesforce → SOQL strings):

```qore
public const SoqlExpressions = {
    DP_OP_AND: {
        "exp": AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_OP_AND},
        "impl": string sub (object iter, list<auto> args) {
            list<string> clauses = map iter.processExpressionArg($1), args;
            return "(" + (foldl $1 + " and " + $2, clauses) + ")";
        },
    },
    DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ: {
        "exp": AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions{DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ},
        "impl": string sub (object iter, string field, auto value) {
            return sprintf("%s = %s", field, iter.getArgValue(field, value));
        },
    },
    // ...
};
```

### Declaring Expressions in ProviderInfo

```qore
const ProviderInfo = <DataProviderInfo>{
    // ... other fields ...
    "expressions": cast<hash<string, hash<DataProviderExpressionInfo>>>(
        map {$1.key: $1.value.exp}, MyExpressions.pairIterator()
    ),
    "supports_search_expressions": True,
};
```

### processExpressionArg() Method

The record iterator needs a public `processExpressionArg()` method that logical operator `impl`
closures can call recursively:

```qore
hash<auto> processExpressionArg(hash<DataProviderExpression> exp) {
    *hash<auto> expinfo = MyExpressions{exp.exp};
    if (!expinfo) {
        throw "WHERE-ERROR", sprintf("unknown operator %y; known: %y", exp.exp, keys MyExpressions);
    }

    # Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT): pass all args to impl for recursive processing
    if (exp.exp == DP_OP_AND || exp.exp == DP_OP_OR || exp.exp == DP_SEARCH_OP_NOT) {
        return call_function_args(expinfo.impl, (self, exp.args));
    }

    # Comparison operators: first arg is field reference, rest are values
    string field = cast<hash<DataProviderFieldReference>>(exp.args[0]).field;

    # IN operator: collect all value args into a list
    if (exp.exp == DP_SEARCH_OP_IN) {
        list<auto> values;
        for (int j = 1; j < exp.args.size(); ++j) {
            if (exp.args[j].typeCode() == NT_LIST) {
                values += exp.args[j];
            } else {
                push values, exp.args[j];
            }
        }
        return call_function_args(expinfo.impl, (field, values));
    }

    # BETWEEN: field + lo + hi
    if (exp.exp == DP_SEARCH_OP_BETWEEN) {
        return call_function_args(expinfo.impl, (field, exp.args[1], exp.args[2]));
    }

    # Standard comparison: field + value
    return call_function_args(expinfo.impl, (field, exp.args[1]));
}
```

### Processing where_cond in the Iterator

The iterator constructor processes `where_cond` to build the backend filter:

```qore
constructor(RestClient rest, string collection, *hash<auto> where_cond,
        *hash<auto> search_options) {
    // ... build body from search_options ...

    if (where_cond) {
        *hash<auto> where_filter = processWhereCondition(where_cond);
        if (where_filter) {
            where_filter = ensureValidFilter(where_filter);
            if (body.filter) {
                // Merge with search_options filter using AND
                body.filter = {"must": (where_filter, body.filter)};
            } else {
                body.filter = where_filter;
            }
        }
    }
}

private *hash<auto> processWhereCondition(hash<auto> where_cond) {
    if (where_cond.exp) {
        return processExpressionArg(cast<hash<DataProviderExpression>>(where_cond));
    }
    // Plain hash: convert each key: value to equality conditions
    list<auto> conditions;
    foreach hash<auto> pair in (where_cond.pairIterator()) {
        push conditions, {"key": pair.key, "match": {"value": pair.value}};
    }
    if (conditions.size() == 1) { return conditions[0]; }
    return {"must": conditions};
}
```

### Update/Delete with Expressions

When `supports_search_expressions` is True, the framework converts ALL where_cond hashes to
`DataProviderExpression` objects — including for update and delete operations. If your update/delete
methods extract fields from where_cond (e.g., `where_cond.id`), you must handle the
`DataProviderExpression` case:

```qore
private list<auto> getPointIds(*hash<auto> where_cond, string operation) {
    if (!where_cond) {
        throw "ERROR", "missing 'id' in where_cond";
    }

    # Handle DataProviderExpression (from framework expression conversion)
    if (where_cond instanceof hash<DataProviderExpression>) {
        return extractIdsFromExpression(
            cast<hash<DataProviderExpression>>(where_cond), operation);
    }

    # Plain hash fallback
    return where_cond.id.typeCode() == NT_LIST ? where_cond.id : (where_cond.id,);
}

private list<auto> extractIdsFromExpression(hash<DataProviderExpression> exp, string op) {
    switch (exp.exp) {
        case DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ: {
            if (exp.args[0] instanceof hash<DataProviderFieldReference>
                    && cast<hash<DataProviderFieldReference>>(exp.args[0]).field == "id") {
                auto val = exp.args[1];
                return val.typeCode() == NT_LIST ? val : (val,);
            }
            break;
        }
        case DP_OP_AND: {
            foreach auto arg in (exp.args) {
                if (arg instanceof hash<DataProviderExpression>) {
                    try { return extractIdsFromExpression(cast<hash<DataProviderExpression>>(arg), op); }
                    catch () {}
                }
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    throw "ERROR", sprintf("where_cond must reference 'id' field for %s", op);
}
```

### Dynamic Payload Fields

If your backend has dynamic/schemaless fields (e.g., Qdrant payloads, MongoDB documents), override
`searchAcceptsForeignField()` to allow field names not in the record type:

```qore
bool searchAcceptsForeignField(string field) {
    return True;
}
```

Without this, the framework rejects plain hash where_cond keys that aren't in the declared record
type.

### Supported Operators

The standard DataProvider operators available in `AbstractDataProvider::GenericExpressions`:

| Operator | Constant | Expression Args | Description |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| AND | `DP_OP_AND` | `(expr, expr, ...)` | Logical AND of sub-expressions |
| OR | `DP_OP_OR` | `(expr, expr, ...)` | Logical OR of sub-expressions |
| NOT | `DP_SEARCH_OP_NOT` | `(expr,)` | Logical negation |
| EQ | `DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ` | `(field_ref, value)` | Equality |
| NE | `DP_SEARCH_OP_NE` | `(field_ref, value)` | Not equal |
| LT | `DP_SEARCH_OP_LT` | `(field_ref, value)` | Less than |
| LE | `DP_SEARCH_OP_LE` | `(field_ref, value)` | Less than or equal |
| GT | `DP_SEARCH_OP_GT` | `(field_ref, value)` | Greater than |
| GE | `DP_SEARCH_OP_GE` | `(field_ref, value)` | Greater than or equal |
| BETWEEN | `DP_SEARCH_OP_BETWEEN` | `(field_ref, lo, hi)` | Range (exclusive) |
| IN | `DP_SEARCH_OP_IN` | `(field_ref, val, ...)` | Value in list |
| REGEX | `DP_SEARCH_OP_REGEX` | `(field_ref, pattern)` | Regex match |

### Constructing Expression Trees in Tests

```qore
# Simple equality
hash<DataProviderExpression> eq_expr = <DataProviderExpression>{
    "exp": DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ,
    "args": (
        <DataProviderFieldReference>{"field": "city"},
        "Berlin",
    ),
};

# Compound: AND(EQ, GT)
hash<DataProviderExpression> and_expr = <DataProviderExpression>{
    "exp": DP_OP_AND,
    "args": (
        <DataProviderExpression>{
            "exp": DP_SEARCH_OP_EQ,
            "args": (<DataProviderFieldReference>{"field": "country"}, "Germany"),
        },
        <DataProviderExpression>{
            "exp": DP_SEARCH_OP_GT,
            "args": (<DataProviderFieldReference>{"field": "population"}, 1000000),
        },
    ),
};

# IN with multiple values
hash<DataProviderExpression> in_expr = <DataProviderExpression>{
    "exp": DP_SEARCH_OP_IN,
    "args": (
        <DataProviderFieldReference>{"field": "city"},
        ("Berlin", "Paris", "Moscow"),
    ),
};

# Plain hash where_cond (implicit EQ, framework converts to expressions)
AbstractDataProviderRecordIterator iter = prov.searchRecords({"city": "Berlin"}, {"limit": 10});
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Using `token` instead of `apikey`
Inherited `token` option has special handling. Use custom name like `apikey`.

### 2. Required options in event provider constructors
Event providers created via path navigation without options. Use optional types (`*string`), get values from context in `observersReady()`.

### 3. Wrong path for DPAT_FIND_SINGLE
Point to collection provider (`/items`), not single item provider (`/items/get`).

### 4. Missing `auto_url` URL construction
For `auto_url: True`, must implement `getConfig()` to build URL from options.

### 5. Missing reference data methods
For `ref_data` in action options, implement `getSupportedReferenceData()` and `getReferenceDataImpl()`.

### 6. Hardcoded OAuth2 URLs
For regional services (Zoho, Salesforce), build OAuth2 URLs dynamically from domain option. Hardcoded URLs break for non-US users.

### 7. Leading slash in ping path
If base URL has path component, ping path must be relative (no leading slash) or it bypasses the base path.

### 8. JSON vs Form-Encoded
Some APIs (JotForm) expect form-encoded data, not JSON. API may return 200 OK but silently ignore JSON body. Always verify data format per endpoint.

```qore
// For form-encoded APIs
rest.setSerialization("text");
on_exit rest.setSerialization(old);
rest.post(path, encoded_body, NOTHING, {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"});
```

**`setSerialization()` mutates client-wide state shared between provider objects and
threads**, so even the save/restore form above is only safe when the client is not
shared. Prefer `restDoRawRequest()`, which takes the body and content type per call.

### 8a. Binary bodies must never go through the JSON codec
A connection with `data = "json"` base64-encodes a `binary` body into a JSON string,
and the server stores the corrupted result **and returns success** — 256 bytes became
346 in the OneDrive case (fixed in `8c11c406b`). There is no error to notice; the
damage is only visible on download.

Send binary through `restDoRawRequest()`. Do not reach for
`setSerialization("bin")`: besides the shared-state problem above, it changes the
codec for every request the client makes, including concurrent ones on other threads.

### 9. Missing FactoryMap entry
Module works when loaded directly but doesn't appear in the apps list. Add to `DataProvider.qc` -> `FactoryMap`.

### 10. Allowed values in option descriptions
Never describe allowed values in the `desc` or `short_desc` text. Always declare them explicitly using the `allowed_values` field in `DataProviderOptionInfo`, `ConnectionOptionInfo`, or `ActionOptionInfo`. Text descriptions of allowed values cannot be parsed by the UI for dropdown generation.

### 11. Missing `options` or `output_type` in action registration
Every `registerAction()` call **must** include `options` (generated via `getActionOptionFromFields()`) and `output_type`. Without `options`, the action shows an empty form and users cannot configure it. Without `output_type`, output fields are invisible. This is the primary user interface — actions without these fields are unusable.

### 12. Field ordering in request types
Fields with `required_groups` must be declared first in the `Fields` constant, followed by required fields, then optional fields. This ensures the UI presents primary input options at the top of the form. When `required_groups` fields are scattered among optional fields, users may not see the main input choices without scrolling.

### 12a. `required_groups` must be inside `attr` for nested type fields
When defining `required_groups` on fields inside a `HashDataType` subclass (used via `addQoreFields()`), the `required_groups` key **must** be inside the `attr` hash. `QoreDataField` only reads attributes from `h.attr` — top-level keys like `"required_groups"` on the field hash are silently ignored.

**Wrong** — `required_groups` at top level of field hash (ignored by `QoreDataField`):
```qore
"content": {
    "display_name": "Content",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."*string",
    "required_groups": ("message_content",),  # WRONG: silently ignored
},
```

**Correct** — `required_groups` inside `attr`:
```qore
"content": {
    "display_name": "Content",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."*string",
    "attr": {
        "required_groups": ("message_content",),
    },
},
```

Note: For top-level action option fields processed by `getActionOptionFromFields()`, either location works because that method explicitly reads `required_groups` from the field hash. But for fields in nested types (e.g., list element types), only the `attr` approach works.

### 13. Single-key hash slicing
`Fields{"key"}` or `getFields(){"key"}` returns the value at that key (single-value dereference). For a single-key hash slice that returns a hash, use a trailing comma: `Fields{"key",}`. This is critical when passing fields to `getActionOptionFromFields()`, which expects a hash of field definitions — passing a single field's value instead of a hash causes `OPTION-ERROR` at module load time.

### 14. Type classes outside namespace block
Type classes declared in a `.qc` file **must** be inside the `public namespace ModuleName { ... }` block. If declared outside it (even in the same file), their class constants (e.g., `Fields`) cannot be resolved via `ClassName::ConstantName` from the `.qm` file, causing `PARSE-EXCEPTION: cannot resolve bareword` errors at module load time. See [Request Type Fields Pattern](#request-type-fields-pattern).

### 15. Description formatting issues
`desc` fields are rendered as markdown in the UI. Common mistakes that degrade readability:
- **Bare `True`/`False`/`NOTHING`**: Always wrap in backticks — `` `True` ``, `` `False` ``, `` `NOTHING` ``
- **Bare field/option names**: Use backticks for cross-references — `` `ssl_key_path` ``, `` `header_names` ``
- **Single quotes for code values**: Use backticks not single quotes — `` `xlsx` `` not `'xlsx'`
- **Lowercase sentence starts**: Every sentence in `desc` must start with a capital letter
- **Wall-of-text long descriptions**: Descriptions >500 chars should use bold section headers (`**Section**:`) and bullet lists (`- `item``) — see [Description Formatting](#description-formatting)
- **Unclosed backticks**: Always verify backtick pairs are matched; a missing opening or closing backtick breaks markdown rendering for the rest of the description

### 16. Scheme literal must match registered scheme (silent InvalidConnection)
URL constants (`DefaultConnectionUrl`, default values, examples in comments) must use a scheme that's actually registered via `ConnectionSchemeCache::registerScheme()`. A typo'd scheme like `myservices://` (extra `s`) when only `myservice` is registered makes every connection an `(InvalidConnection)` with `type: "invalid"`, `app: nothing`, no provider — and the connection silently disappears from the action picker. Surfaces as `URL-ARG-ERROR: ... references unknown scheme ...` in connection alerts. See [Connection Scheme Registration](#connection-scheme-registration).

### 17. `auto_url: True` with no source options falls back to `<scheme>://localhost`
When `auto_url: True` is declared but there's no domain/region option to build a URL from, and `getConfig()` doesn't override the URL, the framework substitutes `<scheme>://localhost`. Every connection then gets `SOCKET-CONNECT-ERROR: Connection refused` against localhost. For fixed-endpoint APIs, hard-code the URL in `getConfig()` (and add a `setUpdateOptionsCode()` re-fix). See [Auto-URL Connections](#auto-url-connections).

### 18. Action `path` must resolve to the root provider's child tree
Every `registerAction()` `path` is resolved against the root provider's `ChildMap` to acquire the backing data provider. If the path doesn't resolve, the framework leaves `prov` null and silently disables `ref_data` lookups (empty dropdowns) and action execution (`INVALID-CHILD-PROVIDER`). Choose either flat `ChildMap` with flat paths, or nested `ChildMap` with nested paths — never mix. See [Action Path Resolution](#action-path-resolution-critical).

### 19. Method name/signature mismatches silently disable overrides
Qore's method dispatch matches overrides by both name AND parameter list against the abstract base. A typo in the method name (`getSupportedReferenceDataImpl` instead of `getSupportedReferenceData`) or an extra parameter (`getReferenceDataImpl(string, *string, *hash)` instead of `(string, *hash)`) means the override is never installed — the framework falls through to the no-op base. No exception, no log, just silent feature failure. Always copy the signature verbatim from `qlib/DataProvider/AbstractDataProvider.qc`. See [Reference Data (Dropdowns)](#reference-data-dropdowns).

### 20. `HashDataType("Name", Fields)` constructor pattern silently drops fields
The constructor overload `(string name, *hash<auto> options, ...)` matches before the fields-aware overload, so passing `Fields` as the second positional arg makes Qore treat it as `options`. The type ends up with the right name but no registered fields. Tests pass (wire payload still serializes), but the UI sees a generic empty hash for every typed field. Always register fields with `addQoreFields(Fields)` from inside the constructor body. See [HashDataType Constructor Pattern](#hashdatatype-constructor-pattern).

### 15. Wrong `getRecordTypeImpl()` return type

Collection data providers (those supporting `DPAT_FIND`) must override `getRecordTypeImpl()` with the correct signature and return type. The base class declares:

```qore
private *hash<string, AbstractDataField> getRecordTypeImpl(*hash<auto> search_options) {
    throwUnimplementedException();
}
```

**Wrong** — returns the data type object, not its fields:
```qore
private *AbstractDataProviderType getRecordTypeImpl() {
    return new MyRecordDataType();  # WRONG: causes RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR
}
```

**Correct** — returns the fields hash with matching signature:
```qore
private *hash<string, AbstractDataField> getRecordTypeImpl(*hash<auto> search_options) {
    return new MyRecordDataType().getFields();  # Correct
}
```

Returning `new XxxDataType()` directly creates a no-arg overload that does not properly override the base method. When the action catalog calls `getRecordType()` to acquire the output type description for a `DPAT_FIND` action, the base class tries to return the result of `getRecordTypeImpl()` as `*hash<string, AbstractDataField>`, causing:

```
RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR: <return statement> expects type '*hash<string, object<AbstractDataField>>',
but got an object of class 'MyRecordDataType' instead
```

The fix is to always call `.getFields()` on the data type instance and use the correct method signature.
