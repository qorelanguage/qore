# Data Provider Implementation Checklist

Comprehensive checklist combining structural verification and quality validation for data provider modules. Run this checklist before marking any data provider work complete.

See also: [data-provider-development-guide.md](data-provider-development-guide.md) for patterns and examples,
and [data-provider-rest-schema-apps.md](data-provider-rest-schema-apps.md) when actions are generated from a
vendored OpenAPI 3 schema rather than written by hand (sections 3-8 and 12 are then owned by the manifest and
its overlay, not by module code).

---

## 1. REST Client Module

### Connection Setup
- [ ] Scheme registered in `qlib/ConnectionProvider/ConnectionSchemeCache.qc` -> `SchemeMap`
- [ ] Connection class overrides `getAppName()` — the base returns nothing, so a connection that does not is never associated with its app and `getInfo()` omits `app` entirely
- [ ] **Every URL constant in the module uses a scheme that's actually registered.** Grep for every `<scheme>://` literal in the REST client `.qm` (default URLs, examples, `oauth2_*_url`, `ping` defaults) and verify each scheme matches one in the module's `ConnectionScheme.schemes` hash. A typo like `myservices` (extra `s`) when only `myservice` is registered makes every connection an `(InvalidConnection)` with `type: "invalid"` and no `app` — silently filtered out of the action picker. Surfaces as `URL-ARG-ERROR: references unknown scheme` in connection alerts but only after a connection is created.
- [ ] `auto_url: True` only if URL can be built from connection options (domain/region/host)
- [ ] **For fixed-endpoint APIs (single global URL, no per-tenant domain), `getConfig()` hard-codes the URL.** Without an override, the framework's auto_url machinery falls back to `<scheme>://localhost` and every connection fails with `SOCKET-CONNECT-ERROR: Connection refused`. Pair with `setUpdateOptionsCode()` to auto-correct any options update.
- [ ] `getConfig()` builds URL from domain/region options (not hardcoded) **OR** force-overrides with the canonical URL for single-endpoint APIs
- [ ] Ping path configured correctly (no leading slash if base URL has path)
- [ ] API version in default URL (e.g., `/v3`, `/books/v3`)

### Connection Options
- [ ] Uses `apikey` instead of inherited `token` (avoids special handling issues)
- [ ] Required options declared via `required_options` string (not `required: True` on individual options)
- [ ] Options with finite allowed values use `allowed_values` field explicitly (never describe allowed values as text in `desc` or `short_desc`)

### OAuth2 (if applicable)
- [ ] `required_options` names the OAuth2 option set as an alternative — this is what declares OAuth2 support and lets the platform supply the client ID and secret from its API servers
- [ ] **The OAuth2 option set is named FIRST.** If an app can support OAuth2 then the authorization-code flow is the connection's default, and an API key or token is the fallback for a credential not tied to a user's authorization - so write `"oauth2_client_id,oauth2_client_secret|token"`, never `"token|oauth2_client_id,oauth2_client_secret"`. Ordering is presentation only: the required-option check accepts the *first satisfied* alternative, so reordering can never invalidate an existing connection. Where the app needs a site or tenant identifier to authorize, it belongs in the OAuth2 alternative (`"cloud_id,oauth2_client_id,oauth2_client_secret|site"`), not on its own.
- [ ] Checked what the platform already publishes: `qrest dataprovider/apps/<App>/oauth2_clients`. An entry there means OAuth2 is available for the app and the client ID and secret come from the API servers. Note its own `required_options` - a per-instance app (GitLab) publishes a client requiring `hostname`, so that option needs a `default_value` and `preselected: True` or the flow cannot be offered when the form opens.
- [ ] `oauth2_client_id` / `oauth2_client_secret` are **not** hard-coded or defaulted in the module (they come from the API servers, so the secret never reaches the instance)
- [ ] `oauth2_grant_type` **defaulted** — without one the flow never runs and the connection silently has no token (symptom: ping returns HTTP 401)
- [ ] **A connection configuring OAuth2 under its own option names overrides `RestConnection::getOAuth2GrantType()`.** The OAuth2 connection features — `oauth2` (any grant), `oauth2-client-credentials`, `oauth2-password`, and the two interactive flows — are derived from that method, and `getExtendedInfo()` publishes the grant type it returns. A connection that renames `oauth2_client_id`/`oauth2_client_secret` (SAP S/4HANA) or brokers the exchange elsewhere (Azure OpenAI's `entra_client_credentials` mode) never sets `oauth2_grant_type`, so without the override it reports that it has nothing to do with OAuth2 and cannot be presented or filtered as an OAuth2 connection. Note that `oauth2-auth` answers a different question — whether there is an authorization step to offer a user — and a non-interactive grant must keep reporting `False` for it.
- [ ] `oauth2_auth_url` / `oauth2_token_url` defaulted and verified against a connection known to work — services often run more than one OAuth2 flow with different endpoints
- [ ] `oauth2_scopes` defaulted
- [ ] Checked `qrest dataprovider/apps/<App>/oauth2_clients` to see what the API servers already publish
- [ ] If the module also accepts an API key: the OAuth2 options are removed when a key is supplied, **after** defaults are applied, and the test is whether a *key* was given — an authorized OAuth2 connection also has a token and must keep its OAuth2 options so the token can be refreshed
- [ ] `DefaultAuthArgs` has `"access_type": "offline"` and `"prompt": "consent"` for refresh tokens
- [ ] `oauth2_auth_args` in `DefaultOptions` and `ConnectionScheme`
- [ ] `getConnectionOptions(*hash<auto> rtopts)` signature correct (accepts runtime options)
- [ ] `getConnectionOptions()` passes `rtopts` to parent
- [ ] `getConnectionOptions()` sets `oauth2_auth_args` if not present
- [ ] OAuth2 auth/token URLs built dynamically from domain (not hardcoded)
- [ ] `getConnectionOptions()` **always** rebuilds OAuth2 URLs (not just when unset)
- [ ] `setUpdateOptionsCode()` auto-corrects URLs on connection load
- [ ] `setUpdateOptionsCode()` fixes ping paths with leading slashes
- [ ] Tested with non-default region (e.g., `.eu`)

---

## 2. Data Provider Module

### Registration
- [ ] Factory registered in `qlib/DataProvider/DataProvider.qc` -> `FactoryMap`
- [ ] **Presentation catalog committed** at `qlib/<Module>/i18n/data-provider.<base64 app name>/root.json`.
      Every app that registers presentation strings owns one, and `examples/test/qlib/DataProvider/Presentation.qtest`
      fails with `MISSING: owner module "<Module>" catalog domain "data-provider.<b64>"` without it. Generate
      it - never hand-write it - with the **repo's** tool, which is byte-reproducible:
      ```
      QORE_MODULE_DIR=build/qlib-qmod:build/modules/i18n:build/modules/json:qlib LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build \
        build/qore bin/qore-data-provider-i18n -C -o qlib/<Module>/i18n -m <Module> --owner <Module>
      ```
      After a framework identity change, regenerate all existing source-owned roots in one deterministic owner-loading
      pass with `build/qore bin/qore-data-provider-i18n -C --update-source-tree -o .`; then refresh every translation
      and run the strict source-tree check below.
      Regenerate whenever a `display_name`, `short_desc` or `desc` changes; the test compares the committed
      tree against what the module currently produces. Note the check only reaches an app once its factory is
      in `FactoryMap`, so a module missing both fails silently until the factory is added.
- [ ] `registerApp()` called with correct fields
- [ ] `groups` includes at least one `AppGroup` enum value (enforced at runtime by `RequiredAppKeys`)
- [ ] `groups` uses only `AppGroup` enum values from `qlib/DataProvider/AppGroup.qc` (not raw strings)
- [ ] `groups` assigned appropriately (see [AppGroup Reference](#appgroup-reference) below)

### Visibility (the app does not appear until the index is rebuilt)
- [ ] After installing, the index was rebuilt: `sudo make install` -> `copy-qore-modules` -> `qctl update-index` -> restart the platform, **in that order**
- [ ] `qdp @<AppName>` lists the app and its actions
- [ ] The index build produced a complete `DataProviderDiscoveryReportInfo`; no missing module path, unknown scheme,
      source-load, factory, retained initializer, or expected-inventory failure is present. Output text is not a
      success signal.
- [ ] Every authoritative or filtered index build supplies the exact expected app/action inventory available from
      its producer boundary, and publication uses a current qualified-discovery token.
- [ ] If the app is missing, checked whether `QORE_PROVIDER_INDEX_DIR` is set: when it is, tooling reads the index and never scans modules, so a working `load_module()` proves registration but not visibility

### Qualification architecture

- [ ] Every producer publishes an exact lightweight app/action inventory before schema materialization; collecting
      it does not execute dynamic schema, connection, or action callbacks.
- [ ] Producer inventory has a change revision, filtered builds collect only their selected app scope, and a change
      after collection invalidates sealing or publication.
- [ ] Every caught registration, discovery-source, factory, scheme, or publication failure is retained in structured
      qualification state. Logs and empty stdout/stderr are diagnostics, not success signals.
- [ ] Failed environment registration and provider modules are not entered in a loaded/visited cache; a later
      qualification repeats the structured failure or succeeds after the dependency is repaired.
- [ ] An authoritative index is published only through a current, authenticated, single-use qualified-discovery
      token, with the revision check and atomic writer protected by the same catalog lock.
- [ ] External schemas are normalized once at a versioned producer boundary. Absent, empty, and null are distinct,
      and conversion to `AllowedValueInfo` occurs only in declared choice positions.
- [ ] Presentation extraction reads only static metadata and declared fallback types; it never executes dynamic type,
      default-value, example, network, or connection callbacks.

### App Info
- [ ] `display_name` is user-friendly ("Zoho Books" not "zohobooks")
- [ ] `short_desc` under 80 chars, **plain text** (no markdown formatting)
- [ ] `desc` is **markdown-formatted** text explaining what the service is (see [Markdown in Descriptions](#markdown-in-descriptions))
- [ ] Logo provided with correct MIME type
- [ ] **Logo stored as a separate file** (e.g., `square-logo.svg`) and loaded at module level (see [App Icon Convention](#app-icon-convention))

---

## 3. Action Registration

### Action Path Resolution (CRITICAL — silent failure if mis-configured)

Every `registerAction()` `path` must resolve to a child of the root data provider's `ChildMap` (or descend through nested `ChildMap`s). If the path doesn't resolve, the framework leaves the action's data provider as `null` — `ref_data` lookups silently return nothing (empty dropdowns) and `doRequestImpl()` is never reached at runtime (`INVALID-CHILD-PROVIDER`).

- [ ] Choose ONE layout consistently across the module:
  - **Flat ChildMap** (Aftership convention) — root `ChildMap` contains every action provider as a direct child; action paths are flat (`/create-tracking`)
  - **Nested ChildMap** — root contains only resource groupings; action paths are nested (`/trackings/create`)
- [ ] **Verify by listing root's children and grepping every action's path**: `grep -A2 'const ChildMap' qlib/<Module>/<Module>DataProvider.qc` and `grep -nE '"path":' qlib/<Module>/<Module>DataProvider.qm` — every action's first path segment must be in root's `ChildMap`
- [ ] Action providers that need `getReferenceData()` (i.e., have any option with `ref_data`) inherit from the same base class that implements `getReferenceDataImpl()` — usually `<Module>DataProviderBase`

See [Action Path Resolution](data-provider-development-guide.md#action-path-resolution-critical) for the full discussion.

### All Actions
- [ ] Each action has `display_name`, `short_desc`, `desc`
- [ ] `short_desc` is **plain text** (no markdown)
- [ ] `desc` is **markdown-formatted** (see [Markdown in Descriptions](#markdown-in-descriptions))
- [ ] `groups` organizes actions logically
- [ ] Each option has `display_name` and `short_desc`
- [ ] Complex options have `desc` explaining format/structure (**markdown-formatted**)
- [ ] Option `allowed_values` declared explicitly in the option definition (never as text in `desc` or `short_desc`)
- [ ] Every user-visible label on fields reachable through an option type, list element, or union branch appears in
      the generated root catalog; nested `allowed_values` and `element_allowed_values` are included.
- [ ] Every shipped locale has exact root message-ID/source parity after regeneration; a fallback to producer text
      does not qualify as a completed translation.

### DPAT_FIND / DPAT_FIND_SINGLE Actions (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Every** action option exists in the data provider's `SearchOptions`
- [ ] `ProviderInfo` includes `"search_options": SearchOptions`
- [ ] `searchRecordsImpl()` handles all `SearchOptions`
- [ ] DPAT_FIND_SINGLE points to collection provider (e.g., `/items`, not `/items/get`)
- [ ] **`getRecordTypeImpl()` returns `*hash<string, AbstractDataField>`** — call `.getFields()` on the data type instance; returning the type object directly (`new XxxDataType()`) causes `RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR` when the action catalog acquires the type description. See [pitfall #15](#15-wrong-getrecordtypeimpl-return-type).

### Field Ordering in Request Types
- [ ] Fields with `required_groups` are declared first in the `Fields` constant
- [ ] Followed by required fields, then optional fields
- [ ] No optional fields are interleaved between `required_groups` fields

### DPAT_API Actions
- [ ] Provider has `"supports_request": True` in `ProviderInfo`
- [ ] Provider implements `doRequestImpl()`
- [ ] **Action has `options` populated** via `DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields()` (without this, the action shows no form fields and is unusable)
- [ ] **Action has `output_type` set** to the response type (e.g., `MyDataProvider::ResponseType`)
- [ ] Non-required options that users will most likely use have `{"preselected": True}` so they appear upfront in the form (required options are automatically preselected by the framework)
- [ ] Single-key hash slices use trailing comma: `Fields{"key",}` (without trailing comma, `Fields{"key"}` returns the value, not a hash — causes `OPTION-ERROR` at module load)
- [ ] `getRequestTypeWithDataImpl()` validates dynamic fields (if applicable)
- [ ] All date/time fields use `DateType` / `DateOrNothingType` regardless of the API wire format (ISO 8601 string, Unix seconds, Unix milliseconds, local-date string). The data provider converts to the API format inside `doRequestImpl()` immediately before serialization. Surfacing `SoftIntType` for a Unix-timestamp field or `SoftStringType` for an ISO field forces the UI to render a number/text input instead of a date picker — this is wrong even though the type "matches" the API. See the *Timestamp Field Types* subsection of the development guide for the conversion table.
- [ ] Required fields match API documentation

### DPAT_EVENT Actions
- [ ] Provider has `"supports_observable": True` in `ProviderInfo`
- [ ] `action_val` matches an event key in `getEventTypesImpl()`

---

## 4. Action Option Sufficiency

The goal: actions should expose enough API functionality to be genuinely useful, not just the bare minimum. For each action, ask: *"If I were using this action, would I be frustrated that I can't set X?"*

### Create Actions
- [ ] Common optional fields exposed (notes, description, dates, references, custom fields)
- [ ] Coverage comparable to similar providers (if Salesforce has 10 fields, why do we have 3?)

### Update Actions
- [ ] Commonly-changed fields are updatable
- [ ] Useful API-supported fields are not hidden

### List/Find Actions
- [ ] API-supported filters exposed (date ranges, status, related entity filters)
- [ ] Users can meaningfully narrow down results

---

## 4b. API Field Verification (CRITICAL)

**Every request type field MUST be verified against the actual API documentation before implementation.** Never guess or assume field names, types, or structures. Incorrect field names cause 400 errors at runtime (e.g., sending `email` when the API expects `email_addresses`).

### Mandatory Steps
- [ ] **Look up the API's OpenAPI spec or endpoint documentation** for each create/update action
- [ ] **Verify every field name matches exactly** — e.g., `estimated_close_time` not `estimated_close_date`, `email_addresses` not `email`, `assigned_to_user_id` not `user_id`
- [ ] **Verify field types match the API** — e.g., if the API expects `owner_id` as string, don't use `IntOrNothingType`
- [ ] **Verify required fields match** — e.g., if the API requires `assigned_to_user_id` on task creation, mark it required
- [ ] **Verify nested structures match** — e.g., if the API expects `email_addresses` as an array of `{email, field, opt_in_reason}` objects, don't flatten it to a simple string field
- [ ] **Document evidence** — note which API docs or OpenAPI spec were consulted for each endpoint

### Common Pitfalls
- Singular vs plural field names (`email_address` on companies vs `email_addresses` on contacts)
- Object vs scalar fields (`company: {id, company_name}` vs `company_id: int`)
- Field name variations (`due_time` vs `due_date`, `order_time` vs `order_date`)
- ID field types (many APIs use string IDs even for numeric-looking values)

---

## 5. Action Options and Output Types (CRITICAL)

**Action `options` and `output_type` are the primary user interface** — they determine what users see in the action form and what output fields are available for mapping. An action without `options` appears in the catalog but shows an empty, unusable form. An action without `output_type` gives users no visibility into the response.

### options
- [ ] **Every action has `options` populated** — no exceptions
- [ ] Options generated via `DataProviderActionCatalog::getActionOptionFromFields()` from request type fields (keeps options in sync with request types)
- [ ] Preferred: use `ClassName::Fields{"key1", "key2"}` (class constant) instead of `instance.getFields(){"key1", "key2"}`
- [ ] Non-required options that users will most likely use have `{"preselected": True}` (required options are automatically preselected)
- [ ] Remaining rarely-used fields added without `preselected`
- [ ] Single-key hash slices use trailing comma: `Fields{"key",}` (without trailing comma, `Fields{"key"}` returns a value, not a hash)

### output_type
- [ ] **Every action has `output_type` set** — preferably via `DataProviderClassName::ResponseType` (class-level static member)
- [ ] Response type accurately reflects all fields returned by `doRequestImpl()`

### example_value on Request Type Fields
- [ ] Key numeric fields have `example_value` (e.g., width: `612.0`, height: `792.0` for document dimensions)
- [ ] Key text fields have `example_value` (e.g., text: `"Hello, World!"`)
- [ ] Example values are realistic and representative of typical usage

---

## 6. Option Allowed Values

**Every option with a finite set of allowed values MUST declare them explicitly using `allowed_values`** - this enables dropdown generation in the UI. Describing allowed values in text descriptions provides a poor UX because the UI cannot parse free-text descriptions into dropdown options.

**All `allowed_values` entries MUST use `hash<AllowedValueInfo>` with a `display_name` field** for the best UX. The `display_name` provides a human-readable label shown in dropdown menus, while the `value` field contains the actual API value. Never use bare values (strings/ints) in `allowed_values` — always wrap them in `AllowedValueInfo` with `display_name`.

- [ ] Data provider options with enumerated values use `allowed_values` field
- [ ] Connection options with enumerated values use `allowed_values` field
- [ ] Action options with enumerated values use `allowed_values` or `ref_data` fields
- [ ] **Every `allowed_values` entry is a `hash<AllowedValueInfo>` with both `value` and `display_name`**
- [ ] `display_name` is user-friendly (Title Case, human-readable — e.g., "Bank Transfer" not "bank_transfer")
- [ ] No option has allowed values described only in `desc`, `short_desc`, or `display_name` text
- [ ] External schema adapters convert choices to `AllowedValueInfo` only in declared choice positions; an arbitrary
      raw hash containing a `value` member remains a raw value.

### Example (correct — AllowedValueInfo with display_name)
```qore
"status": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Status",
    "short_desc": "Filter by invoice status",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
    "allowed_values": (
        <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": "draft", "display_name": "Draft"},
        <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": "sent", "display_name": "Sent"},
        <AllowedValueInfo>{"value": "paid", "display_name": "Paid"},
    ),
},
```

### Example (wrong — bare values without display_name)
```qore
"status": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Status",
    "short_desc": "Filter by invoice status",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
    "allowed_values": ("draft", "sent", "paid"),  // BAD: no display_name, poor UX
},
```

### Example (wrong — no dropdown possible)
```qore
"status": <DataProviderOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Status",
    "short_desc": "Filter by status (draft, sent, or paid)",  // BAD: values in text
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
},
```

---

## 7. ref_data for ID Fields

- [ ] Options ending in `_id`, `Id`, or `ID` have `ref_data` attribute (exception: `organization_id` which comes from connection)
- [ ] **Override is named `getSupportedReferenceData()` — NO `Impl` suffix.** The abstract method in `AbstractDataProvider` has no suffix; an override named `getSupportedReferenceDataImpl()` does NOT match and the framework uses the empty default — every `ref_data` lookup fails with `UNSUPPORTED-REFERENCE-DATA` (strict path) or returns nothing silently (lenient path used by the UI). Verify with `grep -n 'getSupportedReferenceData' qlib/<Module>/<Module>DataProviderBase.qc`.
- [ ] **`getReferenceDataImpl()` signature is exactly `(string type, *hash<auto> action_opts)` — two parameters.** Any extra parameter (e.g., 3-arg `(string kind, *string filter_value, *hash<auto> depends_on_values)`) doesn't match what the framework calls — the override is never invoked, no API request goes out, the dropdown stays empty with no warning. Copy the signature verbatim from `qlib/DataProvider/AbstractDataProvider.qc`.
- [ ] `getSupportedReferenceData()` returns all `ref_data` types used in actions
- [ ] `getReferenceDataImpl()` handles each type and returns `list<hash<AllowedValueInfo>>`
- [ ] **ref_data `value` type matches the option type**: The `"value"` in each `AllowedValueInfo` returned by `getReferenceDataImpl()` MUST match the type of the action option it populates. If the option is `*int` (e.g., `owner_id`), the value must be `int(id)`. If the option is `string` or `*string` (e.g., `contact_id`), the value must be `string(id)`. API responses often return IDs as integers from JSON — always cast explicitly. A type mismatch causes the UI to send the wrong type, leading to silent data corruption or API errors.

---

## 7b. Cascading ref_data (Dependent Dropdowns)

When a ref_data dropdown depends on the value of another field (e.g., applied tags filtered by contact, cycles filtered by team), the controlling and dependent fields need explicit dependency metadata. Without this, the UI cannot cascade dropdowns — the user gets no dropdown for the dependent field.

**This is NOT the same as Dynamic Options (§10)** — cascading ref_data only filters dropdown values; Dynamic Options changes the set of fields entirely.

### Controlling Field
- [ ] Has `"has_dependents": True` (signals UI that other fields depend on this one)
- [ ] Has `"on_change": ("refetch",)` (triggers refetch of dependent dropdowns when changed)
- [ ] Uses inline `<ActionOptionInfo>` in action registration (NOT `getActionOptionFromFields()` — it does not propagate `has_dependents`)

### Dependent Field
- [ ] Has `"depends_on": ("controlling_field_name",)` (field disabled until controlling field is set)
- [ ] Has `"ref_data"` pointing to a type registered in `getSupportedReferenceData()`

### Reference Data Implementation
- [ ] `getSupportedReferenceData()` includes the dependent ref_data type (e.g., `"applied_tags": True`)
- [ ] `getReferenceDataImpl()` passes `action_opts.controlling_field` to the filtering method
- [ ] The filtering method returns NOTHING (not empty list) when the controlling value is not set
- [ ] The filtering method fetches only records scoped to the controlling value

### Reference Implementations
- Linear: `teamId` → cycles, labels, states (`qlib/LinearDataProvider/LinearDataProviderBase.qc`)
- ZohoInventory: `organization_id` → contacts, items (`qlib/ZohoInventoryDataProvider/ZohoInventoryDataProviderBase.qc`)
- ClickFunnels: `contact_id` → applied_tags (`qlib/ClickFunnelsDataProvider/ClickFunnelsDataProviderBase.qc`)

---

## 8. Type Safety

- [ ] Structured data uses custom `HashDataType` classes, not generic `hash`
- [ ] Lists specify element types where known
- [ ] Required fields use non-optional types (`StringType` not `*string`)
- [ ] Optional fields use optional types (`*string`, `*int`)
- [ ] Event provider constructor options are optional (values come from context)
- [ ] Request type classes declare `const Fields` in a `public {}` block (enables `ClassName::Fields` in action registration)
- [ ] Type classes are declared **inside** the `public namespace ModuleName { ... }` block (not outside it — class constants are unresolvable from `.qm` if outside)
- [ ] **`HashDataType` subclass constructors register fields via `addQoreFields(Fields)` from inside the constructor body, NOT by passing `Fields` as the second positional arg to `HashDataType("Name", Fields)`.** The parent's `(string name, *hash<auto> options, ...)` overload matches first and silently absorbs `Fields` as `options` — the type ends up with the right name but no registered fields. Wire-level data still flows so tests pass, but every typed list/hash in the UI renders as a generic `hash` because the schema is empty. Verify with `grep -nE ': HashDataType\("[^"]+", Fields\)' qlib/<Module>/*.qc` — there should be zero matches; all constructors should look like `: HashDataType("Name") { addQoreFields(Fields); }`.
- [ ] Data provider classes declare `static ... ResponseType()` and `static ... RequestType()` in `public {}` blocks
- [ ] **Every `AutoHashType`/`AutoHashOrNothingType` field verified against API spec** — never assume a field is freeform without checking. Fields named `extra`, `options`, `config`, `settings` often have well-defined schemas. Must look up API docs and either create a typed sub-type (if 2+ defined keys) or confirm freeform with evidence.
- [ ] **String fields carrying a known format use a semantic string type** — `EmailType`/`UriType`/`UuidType`/`HostnameType`/`Ipv4Type`/`Ipv6Type`/`PhoneType` (and their `*OrNothing` siblings, or `AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."*email"` etc.). These are string-backed — `getBaseTypeName()` is `"string"`, so the wire representation, mappers, and serialization are unchanged — but they carry a `qore.external_name` tag a UI keys off to render an email/URL/phone control instead of a bare text box. See `design/data-provider-semantic-string-types.md`.
  - **Response/record fields: use them.** Records returned by a provider are never run through `acceptsValue()`, so this is metadata only and cannot introduce a runtime throw.
  - **Input fields (request types, and record types used for create/update): only when the format is guaranteed.** `acceptsValue()` validates input and throws `RUNTIME-TYPE-ERROR` on a mismatch, so a semantic type on an input field is a behavior change. Convert only where the regex cannot reject a value the API accepts — e.g. a URL the remote service must fetch or call back (a scheme is required anyway), or a singular email address. **If the value is legitimately looser than the regex, leave it as `string`** — that is the correct outcome, not a gap.
  - **Do not convert a `SoftString*` field.** The semantic types are backed by `StringType` and have no soft variant, so converting one silently drops its coercion of non-string input (and `Mapper` *does* validate on write).
  - Watch the name-driven false positives: not every `*_url` is a URI (a slug, a path, a hex colour), not every `guid`/`uuid` is RFC-4122 (opaque base62 and base64url ids are common), and a `mobile`/`is_domain` field is often a `bool`.
  - `example_value`/`default_value`/`allowed_values` are validated against the type at field-construction time, so a wrong conversion fails when the type is built — make sure the module's own example matches the format.

---

## 9. Event/Observable Providers

### Implementation
- [ ] `getEventTypesImpl()` returns `hash<string, hash<DataProviderMessageInfo>>`
- [ ] Each event has `"desc"` and `"type"` fields
- [ ] `getExampleEventDataImpl()` is implemented (not just inherited)
- [ ] `observersReady()` is implemented (starts polling/webhook registration)
- [ ] `ProviderInfo` includes `"supports_observable": True`
- [ ] Constructor options are optional types (`*string` not `string`)

### Example Event Data Quality
- [ ] `getExampleEventDataImpl()` tries real API data first with try/catch
- [ ] Falls back to `getFakeExampleData()` on failure
- [ ] Fake data has resource-specific fields (not just `{id: "123", created_time: "..."}`)
- [ ] Example data fields match what's defined in `getEventTypesImpl()` type

### Events Container
- [ ] `ProviderInfo` has `"supports_children": True` and `"children_can_support_observers": True`
- [ ] `getChildProviderNamesImpl()` returns event provider names
- [ ] `getChildProviderImpl()` creates event provider without constructor options

---

## 10. Dynamic Options (if applicable)

- [ ] Action has `"data_dependent_options": True`
- [ ] Structural determinate option has `"structural_determinate": True` and `"on_change": ("refetch",)`
- [ ] `getRequestTypeWithOptionsImpl()` implemented (UI field rendering)
- [ ] `getRequestTypeWithDataImpl()` implemented (request validation)
- [ ] Both methods handle missing/null option values gracefully

---

## 11. API Coverage

For each major resource (identified by having a list action), verify CRUD coverage:

- [ ] Create action
- [ ] Get single action (DPAT_FIND_SINGLE)
- [ ] Update action (if API supports)
- [ ] Delete action (if API supports)
- [ ] List action (DPAT_FIND)
- [ ] Trigger for new items (if useful)

---

## 12. Option Preselection

The UI uses `preselected: True` on action options to determine which fields to show upfront in the form. Required options are automatically preselected by the framework, so `preselected: True` only needs to be explicitly set on **non-required** options that users will most likely use. Without preselection, actions with no required options show an empty form, and users must manually discover available options.

### Rules
- [ ] Required options do NOT need `"preselected": True` — they are automatically preselected
- [ ] Actions with **no required options** have at least 2-3 commonly-used options marked `"preselected": True`
- [ ] Key optional options that users will most likely use are preselected (e.g., `status`, `limit`, `name`)
- [ ] Metadata, advanced, and system fields are NOT preselected (`meta_data`, `resource_version`, `channel`)

### What to Preselect (non-required options)
- ID/lookup fields (`id`, `customer_id`)
- Common filter fields (`status`, `limit`, date ranges)
- Fields that define the core purpose of the action (`amount`, `name`, `email`)

### Example (correct)
```qore
"id": <ActionOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Invoice ID",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
    "required": True,
    # No need for "preselected" - required options are automatically preselected
},
"status": <ActionOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Status",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."string",
    "preselected": True,   # Common filter, shown upfront
},
"meta_data": <ActionOptionInfo>{
    "display_name": "Metadata",
    "type": AbstractDataProviderTypeMap."hash",
    # No preselected - advanced option, hidden by default
},
```

---

## 13. Naming Consistency

- [ ] Action names follow `verb-noun` pattern (create-invoice, list-contacts)
- [ ] Consistent verbs: create, get, update, delete, list, email, search
- [ ] Option names use consistent `_id` suffix (not mixed `_id` and `Id`)
- [ ] Group names use Title Case

---

## 14. Integration Tests

- [ ] Tests exist in `examples/test/qlib/{ModuleName}/`
- [ ] Tests verify data persistence (not just 200 OK)
- [ ] Tests run against real API
- [ ] Tests clean up test data
- [ ] Tests call `getExampleEventData()` for each trigger and verify expected fields
- [ ] Tests verify connection ping succeeds (`conn.ping(True)` returns `ok: True`)
- [ ] `%modern` directive used (not individual parse directives)
- [ ] Test file has executable permission (`chmod +x`)

### Field Value Assertions (CRITICAL)

**Never write `assertEq(True, True, "X succeeded")`** — this only proves no exception was thrown, not that data is correct. The API may return 200 OK with missing or wrong data.

For every action, assert **specific field values** in the response:

- **Create**: Assert the response contains the fields you sent (e.g., `assertEq(test_email, result.email)`) plus an ID
- **Get/List**: Assert key fields are present and have expected values, especially fields that require special API handling (e.g., optional properties, nested arrays flattened to simple fields)
- **Update**: Assert the response reflects the updated values, then re-fetch and verify persistence
- **Delete**: Assert re-fetch returns no results

**Test the full round-trip**: Create → Get (verify all fields) → Update → Get (verify updated fields) → Delete → Get (verify gone).

**Test API response completeness**: If your data type declares fields like `email` or `phone`, verify the API actually returns them. APIs often have "optional properties" or fields that require explicit request parameters — discover this during testing, not in production.

## 15. Build System and Documentation

### Build Registration (MANDATORY - grep for module name in CMakeLists.txt)
- [ ] `CMakeLists.txt` has `qore_user_module()` entry for REST client module
- [ ] `CMakeLists.txt` has `qore_user_module()` entry for DataProvider module

### Documentation
- [ ] Entry in `doxygen/lang/120_modules.dox.tmpl`
- [ ] Release note in `doxygen/lang/900_release_notes.dox.tmpl`
- [ ] Copyright year is current (2026)

## 16. Markdown in Descriptions

All `desc` fields throughout the data provider framework are rendered as **markdown** in the UI. The `short_desc` field is **plain text** (no markdown). This distinction is critical for UX — long descriptions become much more readable with proper formatting.

### Rules
- [ ] `short_desc` is plain text, under 80 chars, single sentence
- [ ] `desc` uses markdown formatting for readability
- [ ] Code references use backticks: `` `field_name` ``, `` `True` ``, `` `NOTHING` ``
- [ ] Multiple options/alternatives use bullet lists, not inline prose
- [ ] Important caveats use **bold** for emphasis
- [ ] URLs use markdown links: `[display text](url)`
- [ ] Multi-sentence descriptions use line breaks for paragraph separation
- [ ] Enumerations of values that aren't in `allowed_values` use bullet lists or backtick-separated lists
- [ ] Sentences in `desc` start with a capital letter
- [ ] No typos (common: "maxium" → "maximum", "ysed" → "used")
- [ ] No double spaces in descriptions
- [ ] All backtick pairs are matched (no unclosed/missing opening backticks)

### Common Anti-Patterns to Check
- [ ] **Bare `True`/`False`/`NOTHING`/`nothing`/`null`**: Must be backtick-wrapped in `desc` (e.g., `` `True` ``, `` `False` ``, `` `NOTHING` ``)
- [ ] **Bare field/option names**: References to other fields or options must use backticks (e.g., `` `ssl_key_location` ``, `` `header_names` ``)
- [ ] **Bare numeric values in context**: Meaningful numeric values should use backticks (e.g., `` `0` ``–`` `255` ``, `` `-100` ``–`` `100` ``)
- [ ] **Single-quoted values instead of backticks**: Use `` `xlsx` `` not `'xlsx'` for code values in markdown
- [ ] **Lowercase sentence starts**: Every sentence in `desc` must start with a capital letter (e.g., "If `true`..." not "if `true`...")
- [ ] **URLs/schemes without backticks**: Protocol schemes like `` `mcp://` ``, `` `http://` `` should be backtick-wrapped
- [ ] **Class/type names without backticks**: Class names, type names, and API values referenced in prose should be backtick-wrapped

### Long Description Formatting (>500 chars)

Descriptions longer than ~500 characters (typically action options describing complex structures like draw commands, CSV field formats, or multi-feature configurations) need structured formatting beyond simple backtick additions:

- [ ] **Organized with bold section headers**: Group related items under `**Section Name**:` headers
- [ ] **Bullet lists for enumerations**: Each command, option, or feature gets its own `- ` bullet
- [ ] **Opening summary sentence**: Start with a concise 1-sentence summary before the detailed breakdown
- [ ] **Consistent formatting within bullets**: Each bullet uses backticks for the command/option name, followed by a brief description

#### Example (wall of text — poor UX)
```qore
"desc": "List of draw command hashes with an op key. Supported operations: set_source_rgb "
    "(r, g, b), set_source_rgba (r, g, b, a), move_to (x, y), line_to (x, y), "
    "rectangle (x, y, width, height), arc (xc, yc, radius, angle1, angle2), "
    "curve_to (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3), stroke, fill, set_font_size (size), "
    "show_text (text, x, y), translate (tx, ty), scale (sx, sy), rotate (angle), "
    "create_linear_gradient, create_radial_gradient, save, restore",
```

#### Example (structured markdown — good UX)
```qore
"desc": "List of draw command hashes. Each command has an `op` key specifying the "
    "operation and operation-specific parameters.\n\n"
    "**Color and Style**:\n"
    "- `set_source_rgb` (r, g, b) — color values 0.0–1.0\n"
    "- `set_source_rgba` (r, g, b, a) — with alpha transparency\n\n"
    "**Paths**:\n"
    "- `move_to` (x, y) — move to point without drawing\n"
    "- `line_to` (x, y) — draw line to point\n"
    "- `rectangle` (x, y, width, height)\n"
    "- `arc` (xc, yc, radius, angle1, angle2)\n"
    "- `curve_to` (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) — cubic Bézier\n\n"
    "**Drawing**:\n"
    "- `stroke` — draw the current path outline\n"
    "- `fill` — fill the current path\n\n"
    "**Text**:\n"
    "- `set_font_size` (size)\n"
    "- `show_text` (text, x, y)",
```

### Where `desc` Fields Appear
- App registration (`registerApp` → `DataProviderAppInfo`)
- Action registration (`registerAction` → `DataProviderActionInfo`)
- Action options (`ActionOptionInfo`)
- Data provider options (`DataProviderOptionInfo`)
- Request/response type fields (in `Fields` constants)
- Event types (`DataProviderMessageInfo`)
- Connection options (`ConnectionOptionInfo`)
- Provider info (`DataProviderInfo`)

### Example (plain text — poor UX)
```qore
"desc": "The maximum number of records to return or to affect; if more records are returned or "
    "affected, the operation results in an error; for data provider supporting transactions; this "
    "will normally result in a transaction rollback if a transaction is in progress. This option is "
    "normally enforced externally from the server interfaced by the data provider",
```

### Example (markdown — good UX)
```qore
"desc": "The maximum number of records to return or to affect.\n\n"
    "If more records are returned or affected, the operation results in an error. "
    "For data providers supporting transactions, this will normally result in a "
    "**transaction rollback** if a transaction is in progress.\n\n"
    "**Note**: this option is normally enforced externally from the server interfaced "
    "by the data provider (unlike `limit` which is enforced server-side).",
```

### Short Descriptions That Don't Need Markdown
Short `desc` values (1-2 simple sentences) are fine as-is — don't add markdown just for the sake of it. Focus markdown formatting on:
- Descriptions longer than ~120 characters
- Descriptions listing multiple options or alternatives
- Descriptions with code references, field names, or API values
- Descriptions explaining complex behavior with conditions or caveats

---

## 17. Data Examples and List Types

### Data Examples
- [ ] Fields accepting JSON objects/arrays include property list and example in `desc`
- [ ] Fields accepting CSV/delimited formats document the delimiter, column structure, and an example
- [ ] Fields accepting regex/pattern syntax describe the syntax and provide an example
- [ ] Fields with non-obvious format requirements (page ranges, coordinate systems, color formats) include format description and example
- [ ] Examples use backtick wrapping for inline code

### List Types vs Delimited Strings
- [ ] Fields accepting multiple homogeneous values (URLs, IDs, tags) use list types (`SoftListOrNothingType`) instead of delimited strings
- [ ] The provider joins list values to the expected delimiter format in `doRequestImpl()` before sending to the API
- [ ] Fields with structured sub-fields or range syntax within delimiters (e.g., `page;fieldName;value`, `0, 2-5, 7-`) remain as `StringOrNothingType`

---

## App Icon Convention

App icons (logos) should be stored as **separate files** in the module directory rather than inlined as string constants. This keeps the code clean, makes icons easy to update, and allows standard SVG tooling to work with the files.

### Rules
- [ ] Icon stored as a separate file (e.g., `square-logo.svg`) in the module's directory
- [ ] **Icon has square dimensions** (equal width and height) for consistent rendering across all UI contexts
- [ ] Loaded at module level using `File::readTextFile()` with `get_script_dir()`
- [ ] Declared as a `public const` so it's available for `registerApp()` and connection schemes

### Example
```qore
# In the module's main .qm or a .qc file
public const SquareLogo = File::readTextFile(get_script_dir() + "/square-logo.svg");

# Used in registerApp()
DataProviderActionCatalog::registerApp(<DataProviderAppInfo>{
    ...
    "logo": SquareLogo,
    "logo_mime_type": MimeTypeSvg,
    ...
});
```

### Anti-pattern (inlined logo — hard to maintain)
```qore
# BAD: icon inlined as string constant
public const SquareLogo = "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" ...>...</svg>";
```

---

## AppGroup Reference

Every app registered with `DataProviderActionCatalog::registerApp()` **must** include at least one group from the
`DataProvider::AppGroup` enum (defined in `qlib/DataProvider/AppGroup.qc`). This is enforced at runtime by
`RequiredAppKeys` in `DataProviderActionCatalog`.

Apps may belong to multiple groups where appropriate (e.g., MQTT belongs to both `Messaging` and `Iot`).

Use the fully qualified enum path (`DataProvider::AppGroup::XYZ`) from modules outside the `DataProvider` namespace.
Within the `DataProvider` namespace, the shorter `AppGroup::XYZ` form works.
