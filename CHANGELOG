	  serializing NOTHING or NULL, which may not be correct either

	* updated library to 5.0.1
	* fixed spec file
	* some minor corrections to configure.ac

2008.11.21: David Nichols
	* updated release to 0.7.2
	* fixed configure.ac to account for libraries in /lib - would cause
	  configure to fail before
	* fixed crash when pthread_create fails in thread.cc, thanks to
	  Dmytro Milinevskyy for the info and patch
        * fixed an issue where proper locking was not done to DBI drivers and
          more than one call could be issued to a connection at one time,
          causing crashes
	* fixed a race condition with getAllThreadCallStacks()
	* fixed a bug where thread-local variables (as top-level local
	  variables of a Program) were not being instantiated when another
	  Program called a fuction in a Program with such variables

*** v0.7.1 RELEASE *** 

2008.11.18: David Nichols
	* fixed socket handling on HPUX 64-bit builds where the header files
	  declare socklen_t to be 8 bytes wide, but the libraries expect a 
	  pointer to a 32-bit value
	* fixed getAllThreadCallStacks() (only enabled with debugging builds
	  and with the explicit configure option: 
	  --enable-runtime-thread-stack-trace because it has a performance
	  penalty) by requiring all threads to grab a read lock before updating
	  the thread stack, and getAllThreadCallStacks() to grab a write lock
	  before reading all threads' call stacks.  This function was not
	  thread-safe before now.

2008.11.12: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug in QoreHTTPClient passing a StackHash as a QoreHashNode
	* fixed bugs in JsonRpcClient and XmlRpcClient where a new connection
	  was established with each request
	* fixed a bug in the HTTPClient where a new connection was established
	  for each request even if the connection was already open and
	  Keep-Alive was set

2008.11.11: David Nichols
	* added initial event documentation
	* added AF_UNIX and AF_LOCAL constants
	* updated Queue::copy() to copy the elements of the original Queue
	* updated threading to fix the problem with exit() causing a random
	  seg fault when other threads were active as follows: all threads
	  started with joinable status PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE, threads call
	  pthread_detach() before exiting; implemented a new function,
	  qore_exit_process() to be called instead of exit() that calls
	  pthread_cancel() on each thread (except the calling thread) and then
	  pthread_join(), added a call to pthread_testcancel() in
	  AbstractStatement::exec()
	* updated event documentation

2008.11.10: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug parsing the content type in QoreHTTPClient

2008.11.09: David Nichols

	* fixed some bugs in QoreSocket::send(int fd, qore_offset_t size)
	* updated QoreFile API to use qore_offset_t and qore_size_t where
	  appropriate instead of "int"

2008.11.06: David Nichols

	  hostname is already set

2008.11.05: David Nichols
	* fixed a memory error parsing expressions with the map operator
	* event subsystem fixes and improvements, FtpClient event support
	* implemented module and feature version requirements; you can now use:
	  %requires <module> OP <version>, where OP is one of <, <=, =, >=, >,
	  for example: %requires oracle >= 1.0.1
	  also a special feature "qore" was implemented to give a requirement
	  for the qore library, ex: %requires qore >= 0.7.1 

2008.11.04: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug in QoreString::set()
 	* fixed 2 crashing bugs in Operator.cc with the "-" operator: the
	  operator functions were expecting certain arguments but the operator
	  code was making partial matches and sending other types to the
	  functions.  Added the abilty for an operator function to require an
	  exact argument match for both arguments.
	* added the possibilty to define a default function that returns
	  NOTHING if no partial match is made to any operator functions so
	  that nonsensical results are not returned (i.e. before change:
	  NOTHING - NOTHING produced: "<time: 0 seconds>", after change, this
	  produces "NOTHING")

2008.11.03: David Nichols
	* fixed a crashing bug in the FtpClient class
	* fixed a parsing bug with the switch statement when a case value using
	  a constant was not resolved caused a crash: affected debug mode only

2008.10.30: David Nichols
	* updated module handling: modules are now checked for having the
	  module api appended to their name in descending order; i.e. if qore
	  supports module-apis 0.5 and 0.4, and a program requests feature
	  "x", qore will look for x-api-0.5.qmod, then x-api-0.4.qmod, and
	  then finally x.qmod in each of the module directories
	* default module directory changed to $libdir/qore-modules in order to
	  avoid creating a new directory for each minor change in the
	  supported api

2008.10.29: David Nichols
	* fixed parsing XML-RPC arrays when the first element is empty
	* added the xml string as the optional exception argument for many
	  exceptions in XML parsing

	  as case values
	* fixed a bug in user function call reference comparisons

2008.09.30: David Nichols

	* made svn-revision header private

2008.08.26: David Nichols
	* added BinaryNode::prepend() method

2008.08.25: David Nichols

2008.06.09: David Nichols
	* configure and compile fixes for Sun Studio CC
	* started adding infrastructure changes to allow for "static" class
	   methods

2008.06.05: David Nichols
	* warning fixes for g++ 4.3

2008.05.29: David Nichols
	* split svg functionality out of the qt module into the new qt-svg
	  module

2008.05.28: David Nichols
	* started spliting up the qt module into sub-modules: qt-opengl is now
	  dependent on the qt module; the majority of the functionality of the
	  qt module is now implemented in a shared library so that symbols can
	  be automatically shared in submodules (like qt-opengl)

2008.05.27: David Nichols
	* implemented auto-reconnect for the oracle DBI driver
	* improved library support for DBI drivers supporting auto-reconnect
	  when a server connection is lost and the driver is not in a
	  transaction

2008.05.23: David Nichols
	* removed suport in the scanner for using some keywords as function and
	  methods names as it broke code that should be correct

2008.05.22: David Nichols
	* implemented support for a select code expression as an optional third
	  argument for the new fmap operator to filter which elements are
	  included in the resulting list
	* implemented support for $$, $1, $2, ... expressions as references to
	  implied arguments
	* changed implementation of fmap, foldl, foldr to use implied arguments
	  rather than take code references/closures as this is a much more
	  efficient and concise syntax
	* implemented comparison functions for runtime code references and
	  closures
	* implemented select operator to select elements from a list
	* implemented a workaround in the parser to allow keywords to be used as
	  bareword hash keys or object members (i.e. "$hash.keys" is now a legal
	  expression)
	* renamed fmap to map
	* updated map operator's optional select expression to operate on the 
	  list before mapping instead of after

2008.05.20: David Nichols
	* ensure that closures can be used anywhere call references can be used
	* implemented "fmap" operator to map a call reference or closure on a
	  list and return the result
	* implemented "foldr" (right fold) and "foldl" (left fold) operators to
	  fold a closure or call reference on a list (meaning apply the code
	  recursively from right to left (foldr) or left to right (foldl) and
	  return the result
	* disabled hash_map and unordered_map for internal data structures as
	  all strings were "const char *" and no hash function for this data
	  type was supplied (have to either switch to std::string and duplicate
	  memory or write a hash function for const char *)

2008.05.19: David Nichols
	* added support for closures to qore.  qore closures encapsulate the
	  state of local variables accessed within the closure; closures created
	  in objects also encapsulate the state of (and prolong the scope of)
	  the object where the closure was created.  Added closure tests to
	  test/test.q
	* added memberNotification method tests to test/test.q

2008.05.13: David Nichols
	* reimplemented global variable and object locking to be much more
	  efficient; eliminated nested locks and instead use a "lock-handoff"
	  implementation where the nested object is referenced, then the
	  containing object's lock is released, then the nested object is
	  accessed, then the nested object's reference count is decremented.
	* rearranged execution order to avoid running any code while an
	  lvalue lock is held

2008.05.07: David Nichols
	* updated QoreClass, QoreMethod, and QoreObject to funnel all method
	  calls through the QoreObject class

2008.05.05: Wolfgang Ritzinger
	* created Dir class

2008.05.05: David Nichols
	* updated scanner to allow "exists" to be a valid function or method
	  name

2008.04.28: David Nichols
	* implemented a maximum HTTP header size of 16K so malicious messages
	  cannot fill up all available memory

2008.04.26: David Nichols
	* added SHA224(), SHA256(), SHA384(), SHA512() digest functions (as well
	  as related *_bin() functions)

2008.04.24: David Nichols
	* fixed a design issue with Qore objects; once the destructor starts
	  executing, no other threads can access the object

2008.04.23: David Nichols
	* rewrote the ForEachStatement execution code to be more efficient and
	  use LValueHelper
	* implemented support for memberNotification methods
	* qt: added memberNotification methods to QStyleOption* classes to
	  automatically retrieve and set option values when Qore members are
	  read or set
	* added support for bzip2 content-encoding to HTTPClient

2008.04.22: David Nichols
	* renamed all instances of "FunctionReference" to "CallReference"
	* corrected a design issue with ReferenceHelper; it must take an
	  AutoVLock argument and not provide its own, as otherwise every
	  instance of ReferenceHelper would have its own AutoVLock structure,
	  which would be inefficient
	* started to implement LValueHelper to make LValue updates safer and
	  more controlled and to put the infrastructure in place so that
	  support for memberNotification methods can be implemented

2008.04.21: David Nichols
	* added QoreHashNode::empty() and QoreListNode::empty() functions
	* implemented module dependencies, added "opengl" as a dependency of the
	  "glut" module
	* added ability to save the script directory to the QoreProgram class
	* added the get_script_dir() function to get the script directory
	* added the Program::getScriptDir() and Program::setScriptDir() methods
	* use the new get_script_dir() function in qt example scripts to find
	  resources when the scripts are not started in the same directory of
	  the script

2008.04.19: David Nichols
	* added a public QoreFile::preallocate() method (c++ class)

	* opengl: started adding opengl module

2008.04.01: David Nichols
	* qt: QLayout fixes, QLayoutItem and other new classes added

2008.03.31: David Nichols
	* qt: bug fixes
	* qt: added QStackedLayout class
	* qt: started adding GL support

2008.03.26: David Nichols
	* qt: massive updates to ensure correct object lifecycle management and
	  to move QObject subclass implementations into templated classes from
	  messy include files
	* updated Qore's object subsystem to allow objects to postpone deletion
	  when going out of scope if the private data is managed externally to

	  SHA1_bin(), DSS_bin(), DSS1_bin(), MDC2_bin(), RIPE160_bin()

2006.04.26: David Nichols
	* made assignments such as 
	  my ($a, $b, $c) = (1, 2, 3)
	  finally legal...
	* added CallReference constant for call reference (return value of 
	  type() for call reference arguments)
	* fixed a bug in SSL handling for server sockets; if an SSL connection is
	  not established on an attempted connection then a segmentation fault
	  was generated when the Socket object was deleted

2006.04.25: David Nichols

2007.03.15: David Nichols
	* fixes to on_block_exit and StatementBlock::execImpl()
	* added load_module() function and appropriate internal locking to allow

2007.03.14: David Nichols
	* implemented the "on_block_exit" statement - this statement is meant to
	  provide a clean way to do exception-safe cleanup within Qore code.
	  Any single statment (or block) after the new "on_block_exit" keyword
	  will be executed when the current block exits (as long as the 
	  statement itself is reached when executing - "on_block_exit" 
	  statements that are never reached when executing will have no effect).
	  Therefore the position of the "on_block_exit" statement is important,
	  and the immediate effect of this statement is to queue it's code for
	  execution when the block is exited.  Even if an exception is raised or
	  a return statement is executed, any on_block_exit code that is queued 
	  will be executed.  Therefore it's ideal for putting cleanup code right
	  next to the code that requires the cleanup, and by using this 
	  statement, the programmer ensures that the cleanup will be performed
	  regardless of the exit status of the block (exception, return, etc)
	* finally tagged functions and classes in documentation with parse
	  restriction information
	* made it legal to use pairs of curly braces ({}) anywhere within a 
	  block to impose scoping rules

	  AutoGate, AutoLock, AutoReadLock, and AutoWriteLock class 
	  documentation

2007.03.10: David Nichols
	* updated Datasource class to throw an exception if deleted by another
	  thread while in a transaction (and release the lock)

	  object in case the lock is released due to an exception, etc)
	* added AutoGate class for exception-safe gate lock handling
	* updated SmartMutex class to allow for tracking condition variables
	  waiting on it so that if it's deleted while a condition variable is

	  value of the counter in the constructor (default = 0)

2007.03.04: David Nichols
	* implemented new deadlock-detection framework for all internal locking
	  each thread has a VLock object that tracks locks held; before a 
	  thread blocks, it checks the thread holding the lock if it's waiting
	  on a lock that the current thread is already holding; if so, there
	  a THREAD-DEADLOCK exception is raised
	* applied deadlock detection to Mutex, VRMutex, and Condition classes
	* added SafeLocker class as a helper class for exception-safe unlocking 
	  within a block

	  reference_count is 1.  This should result in an overall execution 
	  speed improvement.  this means that temporary shared objects that 
	  never go over a reference count of 1 will never cause any cache 
	  synchronization on SMP systems.
	* updated configure to try to detect tuxedo version and set configure
	  link flags appropriately (currently only for 8.* and 9.*)
	* removed extraneous "static" from 2 callback functions in oracle module

	  Linux

2006.10.04: David Nichols
	* added internal q_dirname() function to QoreLib.h returning a string
	  that must be free()'ed
	* changed ModuleManager to ignore QORE_AUTO_MODULE_DIR and 
	  QORE_MODULE_DIR if directories were added in advance
	* improved mysql checks in configure

2006.10.03: David Nichols
	* improved GetOpt class date parsing to accept ISO-8601 and qore date/
	  time specifications (i.e. 2006-01-01 or 2006-01-01T10:00:00, etc) as
	  well as the old format (20060101, 20060101100000)
	* renamed include/qore/thread.h to include/qore/qore_thread.h to avoid
	  conflicts with system include files

	* removed GlobalVariableList lock and ensured that all reads and 
	  writes take place under the parse lock on the containing program 
	  object
	* ensured that all run-time accesses to the UserFunctionList map under
	  QoreProgram objects takes place in the parse lock
	* write templated safe_dslist for a singly-linked list with constant-
	  time inserts at the beginning and end
	* updated all Makefile.am files in SVN so that profiling will be enabled 
	  even if --enable-debug is also chosen in configure
	* fixed some bugs in the Datasource class introduced in 0.5.2 where a 
	  timeout grabbing the transaction lock would cause a deadlock on future
	  operations on the datasource (with some Datasource methods)
	* separated the qore Datasource class into a DatasourceBase clas and a
	  Datasource class
	* fixed a bug in the SingleExitGate class where a timeout would cause a
	  deadlock the next time ::enter() was called (also affected the 
	  Datasource class)
	* updated examples/db-test.q to test datasource lock timeouts

2006.09.30: David Nichols
	* changed all StringList classes to be based on STL container 
	  functionality
	* added detection of "slist" container support
	* added hash_map/map support for more lists for quick lookups

2006.09.29: David Nichols
	* implemented makeHexString() and parseHexString() functions to generate
	  hex strings from binary data and vice-versa
	* implemented support for directly specifying binary constant values in
	  the scanner using a hex format surrounded by angle brackets 
	  (ex: <34bef4>)
	* fixed a bug in the chomp operator when chomping a newline at the 
	  beginning of the string
	* fixed a bug in the Queue class; a timeout in ::get() or ::pop() would
	  cause a deadlock on the next call to ::get() or ::pop()
	* throw an exception when fork() is called and more than one thread is 
          running
	* changes to use std::map when hash_map not available

2006.09.28: David Nichols
	* fixed broken ncurses module, made calls to initscr() optional
	* added the hstat() and hlstat() functions to return a hash of the 
	  result of stat() and lstat(), respectively

2006.09.28: Pavel Vozenilek
	* authentification_required_by_Tuxedo renamed to tpchkauth().
	* Finished Tuxedo::Connection class

2006.09.27: David Nichols
	* updated version number to 0.6.0
	* added bea tuxedo checks to configure

2006.09.26: Pavel Vozenilek
	* Module name is now Tuxedo.qmod.
	* Tuxedo module: added standalone function 
	  authentification_required_by_Tuxedo().
        * TuxedoModule: added Tuxedo::Connection class (initial version).

*** v0.5.2 *** RELEASE

2006.09.26: David Nichols
	* removed getSSLCertVerficationCodeString() function and changed
	  Socket::verifyPeerCertificate() and FtpClient::verifyPeerCertificate()
	  to directly return the string code instead of a numeric code.
	* bug fixes to test/socket-test.q
	* doc updates
	* fixed a bug in QoreTibrvTransport.cc
	* fixed a bug in ssl_constants.h on g++32

2006.09.25: David Nichols

	* fixed getByte() to no longer try to use negative offsets
	* sanitized digest exceptions
	* doc updates

2006.09.24: David Nichols
	* changed ncurses module initialization to only acquire the 
	  initialization lock after checking that it's not set outside the lock
	  (then it's checked again) - this is because the lock is only set once
	  (normally) so this should eliminate excessive mutexes (=performance
	  improvement)
	* removed the "synchronization-ignored" warning - synchronization is 
	  global and therefore could make sense on constructors and destructors

2006.09.22: David Nichols
	* error-handling fix in ModuleManager.cc

2006.09.22: Pavel Vozenilek
	* committed initial tuxedo module support

2006.09.21: David Nichols
	* changes to make a win32 port possible
	* fixed type manager destruction when no program is executed
	* fixed a bug where auto-loaded modules were not registering their
	  provided features so module code could be loaded more than once if a
	  "%requires" directive for that module was parsed
	* fixed a parse-related static memory leak in lib/parser.yy

2006.09.16: David Nichols
	* doc updates
	* "tibrv" module: renamed namespace to "Tibrv"
	* "tibae" module: renamed namespace to "Tibae"

2006.09.12: David Nichols
	* implemented the "unreachable-code" warning
	* implemented the ability to return parse warnings if a parse mask is
	  passed to Program::parse(), ::parsePending(), or ::parseCommit() as 
	  the last argument to each respective method
	* changed parseDatasource() to correctly parse a datasource string
	  without a username or password
	* made QoreClass::name private
	* divided PO_NO_THREADS into PO_NO_THREAD_CONTROL (-R) and 
	  PO_NO_THREAD_CLASSES (-X) and respective command-line options
	* delayed QoreTypeManager initialization of default values until after
	  the default character set is set in order to ensure that NullString
	  is marked with a character set encoding
	* minor improvements to some test scripts

2006.09.10: David Nichols
	* "tibrv" module: fixed exception handling in QoreTibrvCmTransport
	* "tibae" module: updated to new internal API
	* fixed a memory leak when deleting qore classes that have pending 
	  method additions (affected builds with and without STL hash_map
	  support)
	* fixed class execution when %exec-class is not used
	* implemented the "-A" command-line option to disallow changes to the
	  warning level
	* added domain tags to builtin classes to allow for enforcing parse 
	  restrictions on class access
	* implemented logic to verify function domains of classes when using the
	  "new" operator and when declaring base classes with "inherits" - if
	  a class provides functionality restricted by the current parse options
	  an exception is thrown
	* implemented -B command-line option to disallow database access
	* implemented warning: undeclared-var
	* implemented defaultWarningHandler() to print out warnings in a user-
	  friendly way
	* implemented warning: duplicate-global-var
	* made it illegal to declare constructor and destructor methods as 
	  private
	* implemented warning: synchronization-ignored
	* fixed error detection and reporting in scanner.ll when a required
	  argument was not given to a parse directive (like %exec-class)
	* implemented "flush()" function to flush standard output as printed by
	  print(), printf(), etc
	* combined some thread tests into test/thread-object-test.q

2006.09.09: David Nichols
	* fixed a race condition in thread.cc where the thread list was 
	  accessed outside the thread lock but could be dynamically reallocated
	  -- now the thread list is static 
	* "ncurses" module: changed the Window and Panel classes to call
	  qore_ncurses_init() before creating the objects instead of afterwards
	  which fixed a segfault in examples/hanoi.q
	* fixed a problem when a builtin class would throw an exception in the
	  constructor and if Object::doDeleteNoDestructor() was not called
	  (which has been removed as a part of this patch) the destructor
	  would be run after the object had been deleted which would cause
	  another exception to be thrown.  Without this function call, builtin 
	  classes in class hierarchies would not have their private data 
	  dereferenced.  Now all builtin constructors throwing exceptions have
	  to do is to throw the exception and then Object::obliterate() is 
	  called, taking care of all private data and Object destruction.
	* implemented a flexible parse warning framework and 3 warnings: 
	  duplicate-local-vars, warning-mask-unchanged, unknown-warning
	* implemented the following parse directives: %enable-all-warnings,
	  %disable-all-warnings, %enable-warning <arg>, %disable-warning <arg>
	* implented the -W flag to enable all warnings and the PO_LOCK_WARNINGS
	  parse restriction
	* implemented the -r command-line flag to treat warnings as errors
	* changed all functions and methods taking timeout values to accept both
	  integers, relative times (i.e. 150ms), or absolute times (in which
	  case the timeout will be automatically calculated from the current 
	  time)
	* updated QoreQueue::pop() and shift() debugging statements to only 
	  output when debugging

2006.09.08: David Nichols
	* implemented the "chomp" operator similar to perl's, added tests to 
	  test/test.q
	* doc updates
	* removed include/qore/module.h - modules should only include 
	  qore/ModuleManager.h
	* module API changes: module_init routines should return a QoreString *
	  with an error message when errors occur
	* more descriptive errors are reported when module loading errors are
	  encountered
	* if a module provides a feature other than the one requested (when
	  modules are loaded based on the required feature name) an error is
	  raised and the module is not loaded

2006.09.07: David Nichols
	* "mysql" module: fixed placeholder binding to work properly with the
	  Qore DBI syntax
	* removed the "describe" method from the DBI module
	* added a list argument parameter to the DBI select and select_rows
	  methods so that value binding can also be supported for select
	  statements
	* "mysql" module: enabled value binding for select statements
	* "oracle" module: enabled value binding for select statements
	* fixed a object destruction ordering issue in QoreProgram.h
	* changed all references to "%08x" to "%08p" so 64-bit pointers won't
	  throw off arguments in printf format strings

2006.09.06: David Nichols
	* "mysql" module: implemented bind by value and placeholder binding
	* "oracle" module: streamlined some internal functions
	* changed the internal c++ qore object API to handle references
	  internally, greatly simplifying the job of implementing qore classes
	  in c++ - fixed some reference-counting bugs at the same time
	* made special function templates for class constructors, destructors,
	  and copy methods for the most efficient execution, a pointer to the
	  private object is now passed to each method that could need it (all
	  methods except the constructor)

2006.09.05: David Nichols
	* made QoreProgram first set all program-local (non-imported) global
	  variables to NULL and then delete

2006.09.04: David Nichols
	* fixed circular reference count issue between objects->programs->
	  global variable list->objects by implementing 2 phase references for
	  program objects
	* streamlined 2 phase objects referencess
	* "mysql" module: started implementing value and placeholder binding
	  functionality
	* "oracle" module: fixed access to private DateTime members
	* changed the creation of "0 dates" (i.e. 0000-00-00 - an illegal date) 
	  to default to 1970-01-01

2006.09.03: David Nichols
	* "oracle" module: renamed classes to be oracle-specific
	* added a new format for printing relative dates with *printf %n & %N
	  formats: <time: x years x months ...etc >
	* implemented absolute date difference algorithm that produces relative
	  dates normalized to day,hour,minute,second,ms 
	  (i.e. 2006-01-02 - 2006-01-01 = 1D), previously this would produce a
	  nonsense result 
	* fixed another bug with generating dates on year boundries 2 years 
	  before and after the epoch from epoch offsets
	* made time information members of the DateTime class private to isolate
	  the implementation from the interface to prepare for a better 
	  (hopefully more efficient) implementation
	* changed getDayOfWeek() (again) to return 0-6 for sun-sat (useful for
	  array lookups)
	* added getISODayOfWeek() to return 1-7 for mon-sun
	* updated date tests in test/test.q and added more tests for more 
	  boundry conditions

2006.09.02: David Nichols
	* fixed some bugs in DateTime::getEpochSeconds()
	* fixed some bugs in DateTime::setDate(int64)
	* added additional date tests to test/test.q for border conditions
	* changed the getDayOfWeek() function to return 1-7 with 1=Mon to
	  correspond to ISO-8601 specifications
	* added getDateFromISOWeek() to return a date/time value from the ISO-
	  8601 year, week and optional day values
	* added tests for new date functions in test/test.q
	* added millisecond addition and subtraction tests to test/test.q
	* corrected DateTime class to make millisecond subtraction work
	* changed scanner.ll and DateTime string constructor to allow for 
	  millisecond specification for dates: i.e. 2006-01-01-10:00:00.502 for
	  502 milliseconds after Jan 1 2006 10 am
	* changed scanner.ll to accept date/time values in a ISO 8601 standard
	  format: 2006-01-01T10:00:00 (without the time zone component) 
	* changed scanner.ll to only accept valid month, day, hour, minute,
	  second, and millisecond values in dates

2006.09.01: David Nichols
	* added getISOWeekHash() to return the ISO-8601 calendar year, week, 
	  and day from a date value
	* added getISOWeekString() to return the ISO-8601 calender info for a
	  particular date value in the following format: "####-W##-#" for
	  year-week-day info
	* added getDayNumber() to return the ordinal number of the day in the
	  year of a date value (sometimes erroneously called the Julian date)
	* added getDayOfWeek() to return a value from 0 - 6 corresponding to
	  Sun - Sat for a date value
	* added get_years(), get_months(), get_days(), get_hours(), 
	  get_minutes(), get_seconds(), get_milliseconds() calls to ql_time.cc
	* added support for specifying relative millisecond values in scanner.ll
	  as <int>ms: i.e. "$date -= 250ms" will subtract 250 milliseconds from
	  the date value in $date  

2006.08.31: David Nichols
	* "tibrv" module: added the TibrvDistributedQueue class to allow qore
	  programs to be members of a Rendezvous distributed queue using a 
	  certified transport object
	* added -ssl to the TIBRV_LIBS when secure daemon support is included

2006.08.30: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug in the QoreProgram destructor when the ::del() method had
	  already been called.
	* added -lcrypto to OPENSSL_LDFLAGS

2006.08.20: David Nichols
	* updated test/socket-test.q to be an object-oriented script and to 
	  do all tests in both directions (client->server and server->client),
	  also it's now possible to run socket-test only as a client or only as
	  a server in order to run the tests between two different machines
	* "tibrv" module: fixed Rendezvous library link detection and secure 
	  daemon presence in configure
	* "tibrv" module: enabled secure daemon code

2006.08.19: David Nichols
	* removed some unused functions in lib/thread.cc
	* added the QoreProgram::cannotProvideFeature() function to raise a
	  special parse exception that will cause all other parse exceptions to
	  be ignored so that when features cannot be provided the only error 
	  messages that will be reported via exceptions are the facts that the
	  features could not be provided.  lib/scanner.ll was modified to use 
	  this new method
	* fixed buggy the Socket::*i8() methods

2006.08.18: David Nichols
	* fixed the qore binary's command-line handling when the first option 
	  takes an argument with spaces
	* if the -e or --exec options are given then no file name is set from
	  the command-line, instead all such options are passed directly into
	  $ARGV

2006.08.17: David Nichols
	* fixed some errors and memory leaks when a thread start error occurs
	* changed Program::destructor() to immediately run the object's
	  underlying destructor with an ExceptionSink object to allow 
	  exceptions to be caught by the parent code instead of just 
	  decrementing the counter and running the default exception handler on
	  any exceptions - this allows exceptions thrown when deleting global 
	  variables and thread data to be caught and handled (before they could
	  not be caught and the default exception handler would be run)
	* added throwThreadResourceExceptions() function to explicitly throw
	  thread resource exceptions
	* changed objects to reference their parent QoreProgram object instead
	  of the parent class because the class is contained by the program
	  anyway, and the class may have a method that calls a function in the
	  program - otherwise in the case that an object exported from a
	  program is deleted before the object and that object's class has a
	  method that calls a function in the program, a core dump would result

2006.08.16: David Nichols
	* infrastructure changes to allow thread-specific resources to be 
	  registered with a destructor function to be run on the data if the
	  resource is not cleared before the thread terminates
	* Datasource class updated to use the new thread resource registration
	  support to throw an exception and call Datasource::rollback() on the
	  transaction

2006.08.14: David Nichols
	* fixed configure.ac to quit with an error if xml2-config is not found

2006.08.13: David Nichols
	* "tibrv" module: fixed ipaddr32 and ipport16 sending and receiving
	* "tibrv" module: added explicit type-encoded hash support for "bool"
	* "tibrv" module: added the following helper functions to create type-
	  encoded hashes to explicitly declare the serialization type for 
	  Rendezvous messages:
	  - tibrv_i8()
	  - tibrv_u8()
	  - tibrv_i16()
	  - tibrv_u16()
	  - tibrv_i32()
	  - tibrv_u32()
	  - tibrv_i64()
	  - tibrv_u64()
	  - tibrv_f32()
	  - tibrv_f64()
	  - tibrv_ipport16()
	  - tibrv_ipaddr32()
	  - tibrv_xml()
	  - tibrv_bool()

2006.08.12: David Nichols
	* removed default argument value in constructor in QC_SSLPrivateKey 
	* added hash type-encoding for tibrv serialization: to specify the tibrv
	  type, use a hash with two keys: "^type^" and "^value^", where "^type^"
	  can be: i8, u8, i16, u16, i32, u32, i64, u64, f32, f64, ipport16, 
	  ipaddr32, xml

2006.08.10: David Nichols
	* added the following methods to the SSLPrivateKey class: 
	  ::getVersion(), ::getType(), ::getBitLength()
	* added the following methods to the SSLCertificate class: 
	  ::getVersion(), ::getPublicKeyAlgorithm(), ::getPublicKey(),
	  ::getSignatureType(), ::getSignature(), getSubjectHash(),
	  ::getIssuerHash(), ::getSerialNumber(), ::getVersion(), 
	  ::getPurposeHash(), ::getNotBeforeDate(), ::getNotAfterDate()
	* "tibrv" module: started adding secure daemon support

2006.08.09: David Nichols
	* added SSLCertificate::getPEM() call to return a string representing
	  the certificate in PEM format
	* added SSLCertificate::getInfo() method to return information about the
	  certificate
	* added SSLPrivateKey::getInfo() method to return info about the key

2006.08.08: David Nichols
	* eliminated the Hash::newIterator() call, forcing all hash iterations
	  to be done with a variable on the stack (speed improvement)

2006.08.07: David Nichols
	* "tibrv" module: do not time out with TibrvListener::getMessage() and
	  TibrvCmListener::getMessage() if timeout is negative; only returns if
	  a message is available
	* "tibrv" module: added TibrvCmSender::getName() and 
	  TibrvCmListener::getName() methods

2006.08.06: David Nichols
	* fixed a copy-and-paste bug in lib/QC_Socket.cc

	  Rendezvous messages
	* "tibrv" module: added TibrvCmListener class for listening to
	  certified Rendezvous events

2006.07.29: David Nichols
	* "tibrv" module: added TibrvFtMember class to allow joining a 
	  Rendezvous fault-tolerant group
	* "tibrv" module: added TibrvFtMonitor class to allow monitoring a
	  Rendezvous fault-tolerant group
	* added tibrv test program: test/tibrv-test.q

2006.07.27: David Nichols
	* implemented list handling in the tibrv module
	* added a character set encoding value to the QoreTibrvListener and
	  QoreTibrvSender classes to do automatic conversions and tagging where
	  appropriate with RV messaging
	* added OPAQUE <-> binary handling in tibrv module
	* monolithic and Solaris build fixes

2006.07.25: David Nichols
	* added initial TibrvSender class
	* fixed a bug in the QoreString::vsprintf() resize logic

2006.07.24: David Nichols
	* started adding 64-bit support
	* fixed a stupid bug in generating parse exceptions (how did that ever
	  work before???)
	* fixed a deadlock in adding new (unknown) character encodings in
	  include/qore/charset.h
	* fixed a bug in the QoreString::vsprintf() design and usage (retries
	  when the buffer was too small would cause a segfault)
	* set library and module dir to use lib64 for 64-bit builds on Linux
	* changes to allow mysql to be compiled in for Linux x86_64
	* renamed tibco module to tibae
	* moved TIBCO Rendezvous functionality to separate tibrv module

	* make rendezbous and tibco ae sdk detection more automatic with more
	  verbose messages in the configure script
	* added support to link with 64-bit rendezvous libraries

2006.07.09: David Nichols
	* added TibrvListener class to the tibco module for TIBCO Rendezvous 
	  listening
	* changed DateTime <-> integer conversions to be based on the number of
	  seconds from January 1, 1970 (the UNIX epoch)

2006.07.08: David Nichols
	* FtpClient updated to understand the "ftps://" protocol as per RFC-2228
	  and RFC-4217: for AUTH TLS secure logins implemented
	* FtpClient updated to use secure data connections using PBSZ 0 and

	  QoreStrings must have an encoding set

2006.07.07: David Nichols
	* added MD2(), MD4(), MD5(), SHA(), SHA1(), DSS(), DSS1(), RIPEMD160()
	  digest functions to lib/ql_crypto.cc
	* added MDC2() digest function to lib/ql_crypto.cc optionally depending
	  on openssl library support
	* added the following cryptographic functions to lib/ql_crypto.cc:
          + des_encrypt_cbc()

2006.07.05: David Nichols
	* changed XML generation and XML parsing to be able to parse and
	  properly generate XML with mixed elements and text.  When multiple 
	  text nodes are present, hash keys are created with the format: 
	  ^value#^, where # is an increasing number.  When elements are	
	  duplicated, then, if the last element does not have the same name,
	  a new hash key is used with the following format: name^#, in the same
	  manner as value nodes.  When serializing Qore data to XML strings, the
	  reverse ruls are used - ^value* nodes are output as text, and if an
	  element name is suffixed with ^# the suffix is removed before the
	  element name is output.  This should allow mixed data and text to be 
	  properly parsed and generated while maintaining backward-compatibility
	  with the previous functionality.

2006.07.04: David Nichols
	* fixed a rare race condition & a memory leak in lib/Object.cc
	* changed ::memberGate() methods and ::methodGate() methods to not 
	  execute when we are already in the method - to avoid silly infinite
	  loops
	* fixed a memory leak in some exception handling code in lib/ql_xml.cc

2006.07.03: David Nichols
	* added lib/ql_crypto.cc with new functions: blowfish_encrypt_cbc(),
	  blowfish_decrypt_cbc() and blowfish_decrypt_cbc_to_string()

2006.06.30: David Nichols
	* implemented a splice() function, which works the same as the splice
	  operator, except on a copy of the list or string

2006.06.29: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug in examples/HTTPClient.qc

2006.06.26: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug compiling on Solaris without hash_map support with DEBUG
	  enabled
	* fixed ModuleManager to track builtin features even when there is no
	  current program when --enable-builtin-modules is set

2006.06.20: David Nichols
	* updated examples/HTTPServer.qc to support SSL (https) services and
	  modular/multiple listeners on one server
	* fixed it so that base class constructor arguments in derived classes
	  can use references to constructor arguments

2006.06.19: David Nichols
	* added constants for X509 certificate validation for SSL connections
	* added Socket::verifyPeerCertificate() method for SSL connections
	* added getSSLCertVerificationCodeString() to return a string code for
	  Socket::verifyPeerCertificate() return values
	* added Qore::X509_VerificationReasons constant to map from verification
	  code strings as returned by getSSLCertVerificationCodeString() to text
	  descriptions.
	* added Socket::setCertificate() and Socket::setPrivateKey() methods to
	  set SSL parameters for server processes
	* created SSLCertificate and SSLPrivateKey classes for persistently
	  storing X509 certificates and private keys
	* added SSL server support to test/socket-test.q

2006.06.18: David Nichols
	* added openssl checks to configure.ac as a required component
	* improved library detection for pcre and openssl to check for OS-
	  specific shared libraries as well as static libraries, in case
	  the static libraries are not installed.
	* implemented new Socket methods: ::connectSSL(), ::acceptSSL(), and
	  SSL session handling, reading and writing in SSL connections
	* now Socket::connect() and Socket::accept() will throw exceptions if
	  they fail (before they would just return -1) - this is to be 
	  consistent with connectSSL() and acceptSSL() which will throw 
	  exceptions if SSL negotiation fails
	* added Socket::getSSLCipherName(), Socket::getSSLCipherVersion(), and
	  Socket::isSecure() methods
	* update HTTPClient class in examples/HTTPClient.qc to recognize the 
	  https protocol and use SSL

2006.06.14: David Nichols
	* updated the tibco module to use a more efficient MDate constructor, 
	  without the need to convert the date info to a string first
	* changes to allow qore to compile and link with TIBCO SDK 5.3.*

2006.06.13: David Nichols
	* sanitized QoreString constructor order when specifying an encoding,
	  added an additional constructor to accept simply specifying the 
	  encoding without giving an initial string value
	* added regex substring extraction operator: =~ x/.../ - returns a list
	  of matched substrings
	* fixed a bug parsing empty data elements in an XML-RPC array

2006.06.12: David Nichols
	* improved XML string serialization to output short empty elements (i.e.
	  <node/>) if the hash has no real members, even if it has 
	  ^attributes^ and/or ^value^ keys, with or without actual values

*** v0.5.1 *** RELEASE

2006.06.07: David Nichols
	* migrated to subversion on sourceforge.net
	* implemented transliteration operator with ranges, i.e.:
		$str =~ tr/abc/123/;
		$str =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
	* added transliteration tests to test/test.q

2006.06.06: David Nichols
	* removed support for building non-threading version of Qore (was broken
	  anyway for a long time)
	* implemented better XML tests in test/test.q, removed redundant and not
	  very useful test/namespace.q test/xml-test2.q test/xml-test3.q, and
	  test/program-test.q
	* changed getByte() so it also works on strings

2006.06.04: David Nichols
	* fixed substr() to be multi-byte character set encoding aware to assume
	  that all offsets are character positions instead of byte offsets.
	* fixed index() and rindex() to be multi-byte character set aware and 
	  return character position offsets instead of byte offsets
	* fixed the rindex() function to treat the optional position argument in
	  the same way as perl (to start the reverse search from this position
	  going backwards)
	* added bindex() and brindex() functions to always return byte offsets
	* added enhanced test cases to test/test.q to verify the new 
	  functionality
	* fixed string splice to use character offsets and lengths instead of
	  byte offsets for multi-byte character set encodings
	* made string soft compare (==) do automatic character encoding
	  translations if necessary before the comparison, hard compare (===)
	  will return False if the strings have a different character encoding,
	  unless both strings are empty, in which case True will be returned
	* fixed "field" f_*printf functions to respect character boundries in
	  field width specifications with multi-byte character encodings

2006.06.03: David Nichols
	* streamlined charset encoding support, make charset identifiers 
	  pointers to a QoreEncoding structure instead of an index into an
	  array.
	* changed the File class to assume the default character set if none
	  is otherwise given.
	* added optional multi-byte character set functions to the new 
	  QoreEncoding class to allow for flexible multi-byte character set
	  encoding support

2006.06.02: David Nichols
	* implemented "copy on write" reference counting for class definitions.
	  now classes in namespaces inherited from parent program objects are
	  reference counted, and if an extension is attempted on a class with
	  a reference count > 1, the class is copied, dereferenced, and the
	  modifications are done on the new copy.
	* thread-local storage now specific to program objects and is inherited
	  by subprogram objects
	* the default root namespace is created on-demand for non-inherited
	  program objects - due to this change, the global "qpgm" QoreProgram 
	  object could be and has been removed from the Qore shared library.  
	  Client programs must create their own QoreProgram, and it is now 
	  possible to create more than one QoreProgram object at the top level.
	* module subsystem changes:
	  1) modules now have 2 initialization routines, "module_init" and
	     "module_ns_init".  "module_init" is executed when the module is 
	     first loaded, and "module_ns_init" is executed whenever the feature
	     the module provides is required by a program object. 
	  2) any "module_ns_init" functions are executed automatically for new
	     non-inherited (non-subprogram) program objects once the module has
	     been loaded and initialized.
	  3) any program (even subprograms) can now parse the "%requires" 
	     directive.  If the feature is not present and a loaded module 
	     provides the feature, the "module_ns_init" function will be called
	     on that program's RootNS and QoreNS namespaces to make the new
	     features available to the new program.  If the feature is not yet
	     available, then a module with the same name is searched and loaded
	     if available.
	  4) subprogram objects inherit the parent's namespace as usual,
	     including any namespace additions provided by modules.  The parent
	     program's feature list is also inherited.
	* small corrections/enhancements to test/test.q - added UTF-8 regex test
	  cases

2006.06.01: David Nichols
	* added option to turn off annoying "String literal converted to char*"
	  warnings with Solaris' SunPro CC C++ compiler in configure.ac
	* updated the File::open() method to assume mode mask 0666 if none is
	  present (to turn of the executable bit unless explicitly given).
	* enhanced regex() tests in test/test.q

2006.05.31: David Nichols
	* modified scanner to accept =~ m/.../ as well as =~ /.../ for pattern 
	  matching
	* pcre: implemented subpattern backreference substitution in the 
	  regular expression substitution operator:
	     $a = "abc def";
	     $a =~ s/(\w+) +(\w+)/$2, $1/; 
	     # $a now equals = "def, abc"
	* subpattern backreference substitution test case added to test/test.q
	* modified the "elements" operator to return the number of characters in
	  a string for string arguments (currently actually returns the number
	  of bytes - planned to be fixed soon)
	* modified the -= and - operators to allow a key to be deleted from a 
	  hash, like so:
	     ex: $hash - "string" : gives the result of deleting the key 
	                            "string" from the hash
	     ex: $hash -= "string" : does the same for an lvalue
	* added test cases to test/test.q for the above changes
	* added regex_subst() function to allow for pcre regular-expression
	  substitutions with run-time generated patterns, etc
	* added RE_Caseless, RE_Extended, RE_DotAll, and RE_MultiLine to be used
	  as options for the regex() and regex_subst() functions.
	* added RE_Global to be used as an option for the regex_subst() function

2006.05.30: David Nichols
	* implemented %= (modula-equals) operator
	* implemented *= (multiply-equals) operator

	* made "shift" and "unshift" also valid function and method names
	* added test cases for new operators and new pcre-regex options to 
	  test/test.q script
	* modified oracle driver to ignore non-alphabetic characters after a ':'
	  character instead of throwing an exception
	* added DBI constants VARCHAR, CLOB, BLOB, DATE for use in binding 
	  placeholders in Datasource::exec() and Datasource::vexec() methods
	* modified Oracle driver to accept an integer as a placeholder bind
	  specification argument to specify the length of a string buffer to
	  bind.

2006.05.24: David Nichols
	* added optional timeout values in ms for Queue::pop() and Queue::get()
	  (both throw exceptions when a timeout occurs)

2006.05.23: David Nichols
	* implemented UTF-8 support for PCRE regular expression matching
	* added runtime support to QoreRegex PCRE class, changed regex() also to
	  use PCRE library functions
	* pcre regex: implemented the /i flag for case-insensitve matching
	* pcre regex: implemented the /s flag to have a dot (.) match a newline 
	  character
	* pcre regex: implemented the /x flag for extended matching - where 
	  whitespace characters in a pattern are ignored except when escaped or
	  in a character class, and all characters after an unescaped # until a
	  newline are ignored, allowing comments in complicated patterns
	* pcre regex: implemented the /m flag to turn on multiline matching

2006.05.22: David Nichols
	* started adding pcre support

2006.05.18: David Nichols

	  copying.
	* implemented exec() function

2006.05.05: David Nichols
	* fixed the socket class to only unlink UNIX domain socket files when
	  created with bind() (otherwise after every close() to a connected
	  UNIX domain socket, the class would try to unlink the socket file!)

2006.05.04: David Nichols
	* moved mkfifo() from lib/ql_io.cc to lib/ql_lib.cc
	* renamed getClass() to getClassName() and removed className() 
	  (redundant functions)

	* fixed a core dump when local variable modifications were attempted in
	  background expressions; now parse exceptions is thrown
	* fixed a core dump where the background expression in the pre-thread-
	  start evaluation evaluated to NULL (now the thread is simply not
	  started)

	* renamed TIBCO module to tibco to make all modules consistent with
	  lower case
	* added perl-style join() function

	  completed if there were no other references to the object
	* implemented Socket methods: recvi4LSB(), recvi2LSB(), sendi2LSB(),
	  sendi4LSB()
	* implemented File methods: readi2LSB(), readi4LSB(), writei2LSB(),
	  writei4LSB() 
	* modified the ncurses plugin so that it can be built with Solaris 
	  curses
	* Solaris and monolithic build fixes

2006.04.26: David Nichols
	* made SQL support non-optional for qore builds (db drivers are still
	  optional)
	* changed build to use libdir/packagename-version as package lib in all
	  Makefile.am files to ensure that module directories are specific to
	  the current build
	* reworked module subsystem, default namespacess, etc to allow for on-
	  demand module loading

2006.04.25: David Nichols

	* fixed the MySQL driver to use the prepared statement interface by
	  default when present
	* added Datasource::selectRows() method (and DBI driver changes) to
	  allow a list of hashes to be returned for queries when needed, Oracle
	  and MySQL drivers updated

2006.04.24: David Nichols
	* revamped internal setup and execution of class methods to include the
	  "self" object pointer directly in the call (more efficiency =
	  performance improvement for OO execution)
	* adapted object and class infrastructure to allow for system
	  initialization of system objects not bound to a program object
	* created stdin, stdout, and stderr system constants as File objects in
	  the Qore:: namespace
	* removed the deprecated "file" basic type and all associated global
	  variables, functions, etc
	* added File::vprintf(), File::f_printf(), and File::f_vprintf()
	  methods

2006.04.18: David Nichols

	* bug fixes in list splice, made negative offsets and lengths work 
	  properly
	* modified list splice to work like perl when the offset is after the
	  end of the list; it will now append the new list to the end of the 
	  list
	* moved xml tests from test/xml-test.q into test/test.q and removed
	  test/xml-test.q (because XML functionality is no longer optional in
	  qore)
	* implemented string splice behavior
	* implemented RMutex recursive thread lock as a replacement for the 
	  Gate class - should give the entire language a speed improvement even
	  in single-threaded applications
	* XML-RPC parsing fixes

2006.04.16: David Nichols
	* completed parseXMLRPCResponse(), corrections to parseXMLRPCCall, now 
	  all XML-RPC generation and parsing functions are implemented
	  internally
	* updated XmlRpcServerValidation.q to give a description for each 
	  method
	* HTTPServer class updated to do (hopefully) correct http 1.1 compliant
	  connection handling (respecting Connection: header tags, closing
	  connections by default for http 1.0 clients that do not explicitly
	  include keep-alive in the header, etc)
	* HTTPClient updated to claim http 1.1 compatibility due to the updated
	  http 1.1 compliant connection handling

2006.04.06: David Nichols
	* fixed segfaults due to complex circular references in class #
	  inheritance (now throws an exception)

2006.04.05: David Nichols
	* fixed a segfault when a class would inherit itself (now throws an 
	  exception)

2006.04.03: David Nichols

	  same class of the object containing the method being called
	* added boolean binding support to Oracle driver

2006.03.27: David Nichols

	* modified Oracle driver to accept NOTHING as NULL when binding values

2006.03.24: David Nichols
	* major overhaul of Oracle Datasource::exec() function, new syntax 
	  implemented (also backwards-compatibility is maintained if the old
	  syntax is detected), supporting safe and correct reading and writing 
	  from strings, dates, ints, floats, reading from result sets (stored 
	  procs that return a cursor), reading and writing *LOB values, ability
	  to specify maximum buffer size for strings when needed, etc

2006.03.21: Wolfgang Ritzinger

2006.03.12: David Nichols
	* implemented splice operator to work like's perl's splice function

2006.03.11: David Nichols

	  object would cause a core dump instead of throwing an exception
	* enhanced NCurses module and test script
	* added support for using certain keywords as function and method names
	* started implementing "splice" list operator

2006.03.10: David Nichols

	* added examples/worm.q and examples/hanoi.q ncurses example scripts

2006.03.09: David Nichols
	* added NCurses::Panel class
	* changes to SQL::Datasource class: corrections to the original design:
	  the Datasource class will no longer grab the transaction even 
	  temporarily if autocommit is turned on, also the transaction lock 
	  will only be freed when there is a DBI driver method exception and
	  autocommit is off and the thread did not already own the lock before
	  the call
	* fixed THREAD-CREATION-FAILURE handling to no longer dump core, however
	  out of memory conditions can still cause a core dump

2006.03.08: David Nichols
	* started adding an ncurses module & NCurses::Window class

2006.03.06: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug where getAllThreadCallStacks() could dump core when a
	  thread did not yet have a call stack (was NULL)
	* added push and pop list operators

2006.03.03: David Nichols
	* expressions in a for statement can now be empty
	* fixed a bug passing a reference to an object within an object when
	  calling another object's method - a reference to the wrong object
	  was passed

2006.03.02: David Nichols
	* fixed a deletion-order bug deleting thread data in the parent thread
	  of a Qore process in the case of objects that are deleted where the
	  destructor methods call a function in the program object where the
	  object was created; the program was being deleted before the object -
	  added a new internal API function dereferenceThreadData() that must
	  be explicitly called by the parent thread before exiting.

2006.03.01: David Nichols
	* fixed the Datasource class to maintain internal copies of connection
	  parameters to avoid race conditions, threading errors, potential core
	  dumps when the connection parameters are modified in another thread 
	  while Datasource methods are executing
	* added get_all_thread_data() and delete_all_thread_data() functions
	* modified save_thread_data() to accept a hash to merge with the thread
	  data hash

2006.02.23: David Nichols
	* added optional timeout value in ms to Condition::wait(), on timeout
	  will return ETIMEDOUT, otherwise returns 0

2006.02.21: David Nichols
	* added Queue::pop() method so that the Queue class can also be used
	  as a thread-safe stack.

2006.02.20: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug with recvi*() methods - they would cause a SOCKET-CLOSED
	  exception to be thrown every time they read valid data

2006.02.17: David Nichols
	* fixed a bug in the TibcoAdapter class where if the session string 
	  goes out of scope and a message is sent, a memory error occurs (or a 
	  core dump)
	* fixed callObjectMethod() and callObjectMethodArgs() to allow access
	  to private object methods if called internally from the object they
	  are referencing

2006.02.16: Wolfgang Ritzinger
	* bugfix for q_gethostbyname(): increase BUFSIZE to 512
	  in QoreNet.h make resolving hostnames and dns names possible

2006.02.15: David Nichols
	* make all Socket::*() methods that read data behave as follows:
	  - on TIMEOUT: return NOTHING
	  - on socket error: throw a SOCKET-RECV-ERROR exception
	  - on other side close()ed or shutdown(): throw a SOCKET-CLOSED 
	    exception
	* implemented parseDatasource() function to parse a dataaource in the
	  following format: type:name/pass@db(charset)%hostname
	  - type, charset and hostname are optional
	  - hostname is only for MySQL datasources at the moment 

2006.02.14: David Nichols
	* made "dni()" a public function with debugging builds

2006.02.13: David Nichols
	* added chdir() function
