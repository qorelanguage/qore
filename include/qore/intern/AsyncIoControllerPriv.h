        down by the program's cleanup path (libqore SIGSEGV at workerLoop+0x3c6
        on a stale spop_obj pointing into recycled JVM-heap memory).

        Items submitted AFTER this call are still protected by the worker's
        \c pgm_shutting_down check at the top of \c workerLoop — those items
        are skipped at the user-callback step and only their refs are released

        This call also drops any already-queued items belonging to \a owner and
        releases their references, and enqueue() discards (rather than queues)
        further items for the owner while the mark is set.  Both are required for
        waitForOwnerIdle() to be a *bounded* wait: queued items are only counted
        down when a worker pops them, so a caller blocked in waitForOwnerIdle()
        while every worker is busy would wait forever for work that can only be
        performed by the pool it is starving.  That is a real, reproducible
        deadlock: a WebSocket frame dispatch running on the HTTP handler pool
        holds the connection's process mutex while destroying a private
        HttpClientConnectionManager, every callback worker blocks on that same
        mutex delivering further stream data, and the manager's cancellation
        callbacks then sit in the queue with nobody left to drain them.

        Draining here is also strictly safer than letting a worker discard the
        item later: an item popped after clearOwnerShuttingDown() no longer sees
        the mark and would run the user callback past the barrier.

    /** Used by CancelOwner / CancelByProgram / GetInfo where a caller
        submits one command per I/O thread and waits for all of them to
        complete.

        Before this class existed, the caller put a stack-local
        QoreCondition + bool flag + std::atomic<int> counter into the
        Command and passed them by raw pointer.  That had a
        use-after-return window: if the caller's wait returned (flag set
        + broadcast by the last I/O thread under the controller mutex)
        and the caller's stack frame went out of scope before every
        other cleanup path (Quit drain, abandoned-cmd drain) finished
        touching the same cond/flag/counter, that cleanup path wrote to
        stale stack memory.  On arm64 this manifested as a single-bit
        flip of a stack-saved return address (`a_inc(&cond->_c_seq)` on
        a stale pointer whose offset 8 landed on a saved `x30` slot) and
        a later SIGBUS in an unrelated function's epilogue.

        Lifetime:
        - Caller allocates with `new AsyncOpCompletion(N)`, which sets
          `pending_threads = N` and starts with refcount = 1 (the
          caller's own ref).
        - For each of the N commands dispatched, the caller calls
          `ROreference()` to add one ref before pushing the command.
        - When an I/O thread finishes processing its command (or drains
          it in cleanup), it calls `completeOne()` to decrement
          `pending_threads` (signaling the waiter if it was the last),
          then `deref()` to drop its own ref.
        - When the caller's wait returns, it consumes any outputs
          (`info_result`, `cancel_pinfos`), then calls `deref()`.
        - The object is destroyed when the last holder releases.

        Skip-broadcast optimization: if an I/O thread sees
        `is_unique()` in `completeOne()`, it holds the only ref — the
        caller has already released and no one is waiting, so the
        broadcast is skipped. */
