/** @file sshutil.h public API for the sshutil module's abstract provider classes

    This header declares accessor functions for the abstract SSH provider
    interface classes implemented by the @c sshutil module. Modules that depend
    on @c sshutil (for example @c ssh2 and @c ssh) must include this public
    header and call these accessors from their own module-init function to
    obtain the class pointers.

    Accessor functions (rather than direct references to the class-pointer data
    symbols) are required because Qore dlopen()s a requesting module before
    loading its declared dependencies: an undefined data symbol would fail to
    bind at dlopen() time, whereas a function symbol is bound lazily and the
    call is made later, after the @c sshutil dependency has been initialized.
    Using a uniquely-named exported function also avoids the symbol collision
    that occurs when a dependent module declares its own @c QC_* global.
