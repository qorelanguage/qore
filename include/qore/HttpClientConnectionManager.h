//! C++ HTTP client connection manager — Phase P3 of the porting plan.
/** Implements the connection pool, per-key creation serialization, proxy
    parsing, and lifecycle management for C++-side HTTP client connections.
    H1-only for Phase P3; H2 and H3 protocol branches stub out and raise
    @c PROTOCOL-NOT-IMPLEMENTED until Phases P4/P5.

    See @c design/http-client-manager-cpp-port.md for the full design,
    including the basics-vs-features split (retry, OAuth2, cookies,
    Alt-Svc, and protocol cache stay in the Qore layer; pool/proxy/
    lifecycle live here).

    @par Lifetime contract
    The destructor calls @ref closeAll, which:
    1. Drains the pool into a local vector under @c pool_lock
    2. Releases @c pool_lock
    3. For each drained connection: calls @c setManager(nullptr) on the
       connection (per the per-connection @c onclose_lock), then closes
       and derefs it.

    Step 3 MUST happen before the manager frees its own state (the base
    class destructor running) — otherwise the async I/O thread could fire
    @c onClosedHook on a half-destroyed manager.

    @par Lock ordering
    See section 7.2 of the design doc:
    @code
    Http1ClientConnection::onclose_lock  (per connection)
        ↓
    pool_lock                            (this class — shared_mutex)
        ↓
    AsyncIoControllerPriv::m             (controller)
    @endcode

    @par Subclassing
    The class is designed to be subclassed by the Qore-level
    @c HttpClientIo::HttpClientConnectionManager in Phase P6.  Subclasses
    layer retry, Alt-Svc, cookie jar, and protocol cache on top of the
    pool/lifecycle primitives provided here.  Member visibility is
    @c protected to support that.

    @since %Qore 3.0
