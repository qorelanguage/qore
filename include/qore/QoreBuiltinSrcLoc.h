//! RAII helper that records a .qpp source location for the duration of
//! its scope, so that builtin variant constructors running inside can
//! stash it on the variant.  `qpp` emits one of these around each
//! `addBuiltinVariant` / `addMethod` / `addConstructor` / `addCopy` /
//! `addStaticMethod` / `addAbstractMethod` call it generates, so that
//! reflection (<tt>FunctionVariant::getSourceLocation()</tt>) can report the
//! declaring `.qpp` file and line instead of the generic <tt>&lt;builtin&gt;</tt>
//! sentinel.
/**
    Usage (hand-written code — normally only `qpp` emits these):
    @code
        QoreBuiltinSrcLocHelper _l("my_module.qpp", 42);
        ns.addBuiltinVariant("my_fn", (q_func_t)f_my_fn_Vs, ...);
    @endcode

    Nested helpers are supported: each constructor saves the prior
    thread-local value and the destructor restores it.  Locations are
    interned in an immortal pool keyed by `(file, line)` so memory use
    is bounded by the number of distinct builtin registration sites,
    not by the number of times the library is loaded.
