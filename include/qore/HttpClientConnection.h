/** This class wraps a protocol-specific poll operation (H1, H2, or H3) and

    a small C++ API for synchronous submit-and-await semantics on top.

    This is the first phase (Phase P2) of porting the basics of
    @c HttpClientConnectionManager from Qore to C++.  Later phases add the
    pool, proxy handling, and protocol cache around this class and migrate
    @c QoreHttpClientObject (sync HTTPClient) to delegate here.

    The class inherits from @ref AbstractHttpPollConnectionPriv, which
    provides the connection state machine (CONNECTING → READY → CLOSED)
    used by the protocol-specific poll operation to signal readiness.

    @par Ownership
    The connection is ref-counted (via @ref AbstractPrivateData).  Callers
    typically hold a single strong ref and call @ref closeConnection before
    dropping the ref.  Dropping the last ref without calling
    @ref closeConnection triggers an implicit close in the destructor.

        libqore", so the C++ connection MUST keep itself alive for the
        duration of any in-flight public method call regardless of when
        the destructor is invoked.

        @par Design

        A single atomic @c uint32_t packs two pieces of state:
          - Bit 31 (@ref INVALIDATED_BIT): set exactly once, by
            @ref markInvalidated, when the connection is being destroyed
            or @ref closeConnection is called.  Sticky — once set, never
            clears.
          - Bits 0..30 (@c IN_FLIGHT_MASK): count of @ref MethodGuard
            instances currently in the @em acquired state.

        @par Methods

        Every public method that dereferences protocol-specific state
        begins with @code{.cpp}
            MethodGuard g(this);
            if (!g.acquired()) {
                xsink->raiseException("HTTPCLIENT-STATE-ERROR",
                    "connection has been closed");
                return ...;
            }
        @endcode The guard's constructor CAS-increments the in-flight
        count unless the invalidated bit is already set, in which case it
        reports @c acquired()==false and the method returns a clean Qore
        exception.  The guard's destructor decrements the count and, if
        it observes the decrement dropping the count to zero while the
        invalidated bit is set, wakes a closer waiting in
        @ref drainInFlight.

        @par Close path

        @ref closeConnection (and the destructor, which calls
        @ref closeConnection) must invoke @ref markInvalidated then
        @ref drainInFlight before dereferencing protocol-specific members.
        After @ref drainInFlight returns, no in-flight call exists and no
        new one can start — the subsequent teardown is race-free.

        @par Concurrency properties
          - Uncontended cost per method call: one acq-rel CAS + one
            acq-rel fetch_sub on a single atomic.  On x86_64 both are
            hardware-LOCK ops, ~10-15 ns total.
          - Parallel method calls from multiple threads do not serialize
            against each other — the guard is a reader-writer pattern
            with close as the single writer.
          - Destructor waits for the specific in-flight calls that were
            already running; it never preempts a live method body.
