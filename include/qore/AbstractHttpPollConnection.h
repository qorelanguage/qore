//! C++ base class providing connection state management for HTTP poll connections
/** This class implements the connection state machine (CONNECTING, READY,
    DRAINING, CLOSED) entirely in C++, enabling:

    1. **I/O thread safety**: onConnectionReady() is pure C++ — no Qore
       interpreter involvement on the I/O thread (no Mutex, no evalMethod).

    2. **Lock-free state reads**: isReady(), isClosed(), isDraining() use
       atomic loads — no lock contention from app threads.

    3. **DGC-visible ownership**: Poll ops store the connection in a Qore
       internal_members slot (DGC can follow the ref) and keep only a raw
       C++ pointer to this priv data for I/O-thread calls.

    State values match Qore's HttpClientConnectionState enum:
    - CONNECTING = 0
    - READY = 1
    - DRAINING = 2
    - CLOSED = 3

    @par Lock ordering
    AbstractHttpPollConnectionPriv::lock (outermost) ->
    Http{2,3}ClientPollOperationPriv::stream_lock (inner).
    onConnectionReady() only acquires this lock, never stream_lock.

        on idle timeout and the app thread on @c closeConnection), the
