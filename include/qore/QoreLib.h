/** @defgroup qore_code_flags_portability Determinism versus Host Portability
    @ref QCF_DETERMINISTIC and @ref QCF_HOST_PORTABLE answer two different questions, and an
    optimizer that folds a call needs whichever one matches where the folding happens.

    @ref QCF_DETERMINISTIC says that repeating a call with the same arguments in the same process
    yields the same result.  That is what a JIT or interpreter needs: it folds and the folded value
    is consumed on the same host that produced it.

    @ref QCF_HOST_PORTABLE says something strictly stronger - that the result is bit-identical on
    any conforming host.  Ahead-of-time compilation needs this one, because \c qcc evaluates the
    call on the build host and bakes the result into an image that runs somewhere else.  Folding a
    merely-deterministic call at AOT time freezes the build host's answer, so an AOT-compiled reader
    and an interpreted reader of the same expression can disagree - structurally the same defect as
    baking in a compile-time value for a runtime-dependent constant, or baking in \c QCS_DEFAULT
    when the runtime host's locale differs.

    The distinction is real for floating point.  IEEE 754 requires correct rounding only for a
    handful of operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, fused
    multiply-add, and conversions - so \c sqrt() agrees everywhere, while \c sin(), \c exp(),
    \c pow() and the rest of the transcendentals are permitted to differ in the last ulp between
    libm implementations, and do.  Arbitrary-precision \c number arithmetic is not affected: MPFR
    guarantees correct rounding for every function it exposes, so the \c number variants are
    portable even where the \c float variants are not.

    @note @ref QCF_HOST_PORTABLE implies @ref QCF_DETERMINISTIC; \c qpp rejects a declaration that
    claims the former without the latter.
