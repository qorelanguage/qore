//! This class provides a pair of streams connected through a buffer.
/** The input stream provides the bytes that are written to the output stream. Data should be written to and read from
    the streams by different threads. The pipe contains a buffer (the size can be specified in the constructor) - the
    reading operations on the input stream are blocked if the buffer is empty and the writing operations on the
    output stream are blocked if the buffer is full. The input stream reports the end of the stream once the output
    stream is closed using @ref OutputStream::close() and all remaining data are read from the buffer. On the other
    hand, the @ref OutputStream::close() method waits until @ref PipeInputStream::finishClose() is called on the StreamPipe object
    which can be used to delay the main thread until all data are read from the pipe in the background thread.

    @par Broken pipe
    A broken pipe is a situation when one of the streams ceases to exist (goes out of scope). In that case, a
    BROKEN-PIPE-ERROR is thrown by any operation on the other stream. This is particularly useful for unblocking the
    background producer (or consumer) when the other end stops consuming data before the end of the stream is reached
    (or stops producing data without closing the stream). For this to work as intended, it is important not to hold
    on to the StreamPipe instance since it keeps references to both streams. See the examples below for templates
    of correct usage and note that the StreamPipe instance goes out of scope as soon as possible.

    @par Example: pulling data from a background producer
    @code{.py}
    InputStream sub example() {
        StreamPipe pipe(False);         # False indicates that the output stream's close() will not block
        PipeOutputStream os = pipe.getOutputStream();
        background sub() {
            try {
                os.write(<01>);         # produce data and write bytes to the pipe using os.write()
                os.close();             # causes the input stream's read() method to report the end of data
            } catch (hash ex) {
                os.reportError(ex);     # causes the input stream's read() method to throw the exception
            }
        }();
        return pipe.getInputStream();
    }

    InputStream is = example();
    *binary b;
    while (b = is.read(4096)) {
        # process the data
    }
    @endcode

    @par Example: pushing data to a background consumer
    @code{.py}
    OutputStream sub example() {
        StreamPipe pipe();
        PipeInputStream is = pipe.getInputStream();
        background sub() {
            try {
                binary *b;
                while (b = is.read(4096)) {
                    # process the data
                }
                # finish processing / cleanup
                is.finishClose();       # wakeup PipeOutputStream::close()
            } catch (hash ex) {
                is.reportError(ex);     # causes the output stream's write() or close() methods to throw the exception
            }
        }();
        return pipe.getOutputStream();
    }

    OutputStream os = example();
    os.write(<01>);         # produce data
    os.close();             # waits until the consumer is done or reports an error
    @endcode
