extern QoreClass* QC_HASHITERATOR;

//! This class an iterator class for hashes
/** Call HashPairIterator::next() to iterate through the hash; do not use the iterator if HashPairIterator::next() returns @ref False.
    A hash can be iterated in reverse order by calling HashPairIterator::prev() instead of HashPairIterator::next()

    @par Example: HashPairIterator basic usage
    @code{.py}
    hash<auto> data = {
        "key1" : 1,
        "key2" : 2,
        "key3" : 3,
    };

    HashPairIterator it(data);
    while (it.next()) {
        printf("iter: %n\n", it.getValue());
    }

    iter: hash: (key : "key1", value : 1)
    iter: hash: (key : "key2", value : 2)
    iter: hash: (key : "key3", value : 3)
    @endcode

    @note
    - In general, the HashPairIterator class is not designed to be accessed from multiple threads; it was created without locking for
      fast and efficient use when used from a single thread.  For methods that would be unsafe to use in another thread, any use of
      such methods in threads other than the thread where the constructor was called will cause an \c ITERATOR-THREAD-ERROR to be thrown.
