//! This class defines an abstract interface for bidirectional iterators
/**
 */
qclass AbstractBidirectionalIterator [arg=AbstractBidirectionalIterator* i; ns=Qore; vparent=AbstractIterator];

//! Moves the current position to the previous element; returns @ref False if there are no more elements
/** This method will return @ref True again after it returns @ref False once if the object being iterated is not empty, otherwise it will always return @ref False.
    The iterator object should not be used after this method returns @ref False

    @return @ref False if there are no more elements (in which case the iterator object is invalid and should not be used); @ref True if successful (meaning that the iterator object is valid)

    @par Example:
    @code{.py}
while (i.prev()) {
    printf(" + %y\n", i.getValue());
}
    @endcode

    @note this method is basically the opposite to AbstractIterator::next()
