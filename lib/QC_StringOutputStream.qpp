//! This class implements the @ref OutputStream interface for writing bytes to a @ref string buffer

    @note stream classes are not designed to be accessed from multiple threads; they have been implemented without
    locking for fast and efficient use when used from a single thread.  For methods that would be unsafe to use in
    another thread, any use of such methods in threads other than the thread where the constructor was called will
    cause a \c STREAM-THREAD-ERROR to be thrown, unless the stream is handed
    off to another thread using the @ref Qore::StreamBase::unassignThread() "StreamBase::unassignThread()"
    method in the thread that currently owns the stream, and the
    @ref Qore::StreamBase::reassignThread() "StreamBase::reassignThread()" method in the new thread.

    @see @ref Qore::StreamWriter "StreamWriter" for a class that can be used to write various kinds of data to an @ref Qore::OutputStream "OutputStream"
