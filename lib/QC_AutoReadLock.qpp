//! A helper class for the @ref Qore::Thread::RWLock "RWLock" class for exception-safe read lock handling
/** AutoReadLock objects, when used along with a @ref Qore::Thread::RWLock "RWLock" object, allow %Qore programmers to safely acquire and release a read lock, even if exceptions are thrown or return statements are executed in the block where the AutoReadLock object is created.

    AutoReadLock objects are helper objects that acquire a read lock for the lifetime of the AutoReadLock object. For this reason, it is only appropriate to assign an AutoReadLock object to a local variable, so when the local variable goes out of scope, the AutoReadLock object will be deleted and the read lock will be automatically released.

    For example:
    @code{.py}
our RWLock rwl();

sub check_error(error) {
    # note that the read lock is acquired in the AutoReadLock constructor, and
    # the read lock will be released as soon as the block is exited below.
    # (with either the throw statement or the return statement)
    AutoReadLock arl(rwl);
    if (error)
        throw "ERROR", "sorry, an error happened";

    return "OK";
}
    @endcode

/** Creates the AutoReadLock object based on the RWLock argument passed. The AutoReadLock object immediately calls RWLock::readLock() on the RWLock object passed, and saves it so it can be released when the AutoReadLock object is destroyed.

    @code{.py}
AutoReadLock arl(rwlock);
    @endcode
