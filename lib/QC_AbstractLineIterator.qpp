//! Returns the current line and splits the string into a list of components based on a separator string and a quote character
/** Retrieves additional lines if the last is quoted and is not terimated; this way fields can contain multiple lines

    The quote character can appear as the first part of a field, in which case it is assumed to designate the entire
    field.  If instances of the quote character are found in the field preceded by a backquote character (\c "\"),
    then these quote characters are included as part of the field's text and not treated as quote characters.\n
    Also the separator character can appear as a part of a field with this variant.\n
    This variant is useful for parsing CSV files, for example.

    @param sep the separator string; if the separator string is not found in the string to split, then a list with
    only one element containing the entire string argument is returned'; if this string has a different
    @ref character_encoding "character encoding" than \a str, then it will be converted to <em>str</em>'s
    @ref character_encoding "character encoding"
    @param quote the quote character
    @param eol the end of line string to be readded in case of a field split between lines
    @param trim_unquoted remove leading and trailing whitespace from unquoted fields

    @return a list of each component of a string separated by a separator string, with the separator and any enclosing
    quote characters removed

    @par Example:
    @code{.py}
list<string> list = "some,'text with spaces, and commas, here is another one! ,',here".split(",", "'");
# returns ("some", ", and commas, here is another one! ,", "here")
    @endcode

    @throw ENCODING-CONVERSION-ERROR this exception could be thrown if the string arguments have different
    @ref character_encoding "character encodings" and an error occurs during encoding conversion
    @throw SPLIT-ERROR field missing closing quote character; extra text following quoted field
