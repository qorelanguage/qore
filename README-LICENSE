The qore library is released under the GPL and LGPL.  

This has been done in order to continue to allow qore to be used in
closed-source programs, but to allow use of third-party GPL libraries for
open-source programs using the qore library.

The library must be initialized with a parameter indicating under which
license the library will be used.

When the library is initialized under the LGPL license, modules requiring the
GPL license (ex: the qt modules) cannot be loaded.

Closed-source programs may not initialize the library using the GPL license,
as this would be a violation of the GPL license which does not allow linking
with closed-source programs.
