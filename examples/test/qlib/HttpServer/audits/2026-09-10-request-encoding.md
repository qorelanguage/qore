# HTTP request encoding audit

Copyright (C) 2026 Qore Technologies, s.r.o.

The full audit-changes skill and its module structure, sandboxing, cooperative
cancellation and DataProvider references were applied to the final encoding
changes. All 62 checks are recorded below: 20 Pass, 42 N/A, 0 Fail.

The isolated Debug core uses prefix /usr, matching /usr/bin/qore; no install was
performed. The changed HttpServer source and private socket header are byte-identical
between this checkout and the tested snapshot. The core library and HttpServer-qmod
were rebuilt before testing. Native changes select the encoding of protocol fields;
there are no new native loops, allocations beyond the existing ownership path, or I/O.

Evidence: /tmp/wsdl-p3-45-core-build.log, /tmp/wsdl-p3-45-core-gate.log,
/tmp/wsdl-p3-45-core-valgrind.log and /tmp/wsdl-p3-45-core-valgrind-test.log.
The gate runs HttpServerRequestEncoding, HttpServer, Http1Persistence and Socket.
The focused Valgrind run uses qore -b --enable-debug and QORE_PCRE2_NO_JIT=1,
with no error suppressions. Tests retain the reused-connection failure discovered
after the buffered-body correction and verify its native header-field root fix.

|15. Uses %prepend-module-path  before %requires for in-repo modules (Qore and Qore modules only; not Qorus)|Pass|The test prepends the local qlib path and requires QUnit/HttpServer using relative paths.
|16. External module dependencies use `%try-module` — except modules delivered with the project itself (Qore ex: DataProvider, ConnectionProvider, QUnit, etc.) which use hard `%requires`|Pass|Only project QUnit/HttpServer and builtin Socket/HTTPClient dependencies are used.

|28. DPAT_API actions: provider has `"supports_request": True` and implements `doRequestImpl()`|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|29. DPAT_FIND actions: every option exists in `SearchOptions`, `getRecordTypeImpl()` returns `*hash<string, AbstractDataField>`|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|30. Scheme-based apps (with `"scheme"` in registerApp): actions use `"path"` and do NOT use `"cls"` — having both `scheme` and `cls` causes a runtime error|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.

|46. No bare `True`/`False`/`NOTHING` — must be backtick-wrapped in `desc`|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|47. No bare field/option names in prose — must use backticks|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|48. Long descriptions (>500 chars) use bold section headers and bullet lists|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|49. **Factory registration in Qore repo**: every factory name registered in `qlib/DataProvider/DataProvider.qc` → `FactoryMap` (without this, module loads but doesn't appear in Qorus apps)|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|50. **`getRecordTypeImpl()` signature**: must be `private *hash<string, AbstractDataField> getRecordTypeImpl(*hash<auto> search_options)` — NOT returning `*AbstractDataProviderType`|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|51. **Dependency JARs committed** (for JNI modules): JAR files in `qlib/*/jar/` may be gitignored — use `git add -f` to ensure they're tracked, otherwise CI compilation fails|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|52. JAR install rules in CMakeLists.txt for all dependency JARs|N/A|No DataProvider action, app, field, factory, or JNI dependency changes.
|53. **No workarounds**: No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or partially-implemented features|Pass|Header strings no longer inherit a previous body charset; pre-read bytes use the request charset. No bypass or fixture special case.
|54. **Exception safety**: C++ uses `ReferenceHolder` for Qore allocations, `std::unique_ptr` for C++ allocations, `*xsink` checked after every fallible operation|Pass|Existing header hash ownership and exception handling are retained. Qore conversion values are managed; all test resources use on_exit.
|55. **Thread safety**: All mutable shared state protected by `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` or documented as immutable-after-construction|Pass|Only existing per-socket parsing and per-request context are used; no shared state added.
|56. **Type safety**: Strongly-typed `code<return(args)>` instead of untyped `code`; `static_cast` instead of C casts; typed hashdecls for results; enums where appropriate|Pass|Existing encoding-pointer constants and typed Qore request/response interfaces are preserved; test fields and collections have explicit types.
|57. **Performance**: No O(n²) where O(n) is possible; no unnecessary copies; coordinate descent uses incremental residuals not full matrix multiply|Pass|Constant-time encoding selection; the existing single body allocation is retained.
|58. **Error handling**: All inputs validated (dimensions, empty data, unfitted models); C++ I/O handles EAGAIN/EINTR if applicable|Pass|Tests cover four encodings, sequential persistent requests, request/response headers, binary payloads, invalid headers and recovery.
|59. **Documentation**: Doxygen `@param`, `@return`, `@throw` on all public methods; `@par Example` with realistic business scenarios; `@note` for important caveats|Pass|Implemented design explains the boundaries and provides a raw-byte HTTPClient example; both release notes are updated. No new public API.
|60. **QPP flags**: `[flags=CONSTANT]` on methods that never throw; `[flags=RET_VALUE_ONLY]` on methods that throw but have no side effects|N/A|No QPP method changed.
|61. **Security**: No user-controlled format strings; no buffer overflows; bounds checking on array indices; no credentials in code|Pass|No new format strings from input, buffer arithmetic, credentials or unchecked array access.
|62. **Correctness**: Algorithms verified against reference implementations; edge cases tested (empty data, single sample, all-zero features)|Pass|105 cases / 987 assertions pass in four affected core suites. The focused 3-case/67-assertion suite passes under Valgrind with zero errors and zero definite/indirect/possible loss; independent XML-RPC HTTP requests also pass.
